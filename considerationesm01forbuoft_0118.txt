of Esther, as we ourselves do, together with Athanasius, and
all the Fathers before 115. But, that either he or they should
therefore reject the book of Esther itself, (which they never
did‚) because of these later and uncanonical pieces that had
been annexed to it by the Hellenists,—or that neither of
them made any more estimation of the one than they did
of the other,-or that this undoubted book of Esther was
never received into the canon before the third council of
Carthage,—all these are but groundless and false assertions
of this Dominiean friar3 for though Melito aud Nazianzen
named it notf, yet they comprehended it under the name
of Ezra, as they did also the book of Nehemiah,—these three
being by many aecounted but for oneg,· and S. Athanasius
is so far from rejecting it, that he refers to the Hebrew
canon for it, where it was never wanting: upon which canon
founding himself for the canon of the Christians, (as he doth
expressly) he cannot, or at least 110 ought not, to be so
taken, as if he meant in his own judgment to vary from it.
But, that none received this book among the canonical
Scriptures before the 001111011 of Carthage, is a manifest
untruth, for Origen and Eusebius reckoned it as received,
(before ς) and, on this side of that couneil, we shall produce
