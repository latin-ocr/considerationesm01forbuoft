the Epistle of S. James, the second of S. Peter, the second
and third of S. John, the Epistle of S. Jude, and the Apoca-
lypse,) we have the consent of the ancient Church expressly
delivered to us by Ruffin, who was better acquainted with it
than some later men have been. In which regard they that
pretend to the same antiquity for severing these books from
the New Testamentffl, which we do for distinguishing the other
from the Old, have not the like reason on their side. For let
them shew such a testimony for themselves, if they can, as this
of Ruffin's is for us, (which neither they, nor any man else,
shall be able ever to do,) and then we will grant that the
ordinary exception against us hath some reason in it, which
now hath none at all, when our opposites return upon us,
and say that we have as little reason to sever Tobit and the
Maccabees, &c., from the canon of the Old Testament, as
some other men have to divide S. JameS, or S. Jude, δῖα,
from the body of the New.
