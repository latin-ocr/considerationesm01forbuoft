tended, in a large acception of Scripture, to the ecclesiastic-al
books3 and that restrained, in a more strict and proper ac-
ception, to those books only which be authentic and divine.
For in one and the same sense they cannot both be taken,
nor confirmed, and stand together: which will be made the
clearer by the next testimony out of Damascen, who lived
not long after this council of Trullo, or the Quini-Sext at
Constantinople, and a little before the seventh pretended
Genera] Council at Nice, that in divers places acknowledged
the canons and constitutions of it.

CHAPTER X.

THE TESTIMONIES OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL WRITERS IN THE
EIGHTH CENTURY.

CV. There are but two considerable writers in this age,
that have said any thing concerning our present questi0n3
whereof one is Damascen among the Greeks, and the other
Venerable Bede among the English Saxon83 both of them
being persons of great learning and renown. Damascen was
a priest of Syria, and wrote many books: but those of the
greatest note are his four books De Fide Orthodooea, wherein
he set forth the body of divinity in a far better method and.
order than had been seen before his time. And from him
did Peter Lombard and the schoolmen of the Latin Church
take their pattern. In the last of these four books he treateth
of the canonical books of Scripture, and numbereth them as
his ancestors in the Oriental Churches had always done be-
fore him, firmly adhering to the Hebrew canon, and count-
ing but two and twenty books onlyd, belonging to the Old
Testament, which he reciteth all in order, without speaking
