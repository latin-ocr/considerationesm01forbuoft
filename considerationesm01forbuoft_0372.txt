A TABLE OF MATTERS

ος πάντων, ὃ ἅγιος Ἰωάννης
ὁ Δαμάσκηνος· διὸ οὐδὲ τὰ
δόγματα ἡμῶν πειρώμεθα ἐκ
τούτων παραστῆσαι, ἀλλ’
ἐκ τῶν τριάκοντα τριῶν κα-
νονικῶν καὶ αὐθεντικῶν βι-
βλίων, ἃ δὴ καὶ θεόπνευστον
καὶ ἁγίαν Γραφὴν καλοῦμεν.]
—And, as for the Epistle of
Jeremy. which maketh the
sixth chapter of this apo—
cryphal Baruch, (and was
never written in that lan-
guage, wherein the Prophet
Jeremy and the true Ba-
ruch wrote their epistle,)
it can be no part of the
twenty-two Hebrew books,
to which Athan., Cyril, and
the Laodiceam Fathers‚
strictly held their account:
aud therefore the epistle
named in their catalogues
must of force have relation
to the Prophecy of Jeremy
itself; with whose style,
and manner of wrsting, this
epistle of the other Baruch
little agreeth. And yet we
cannot but acl-:nowledge‚
that both the matter and
the form of it are otherwise
very highly to be regarded
by us: soritis the largest
dehortation against the va-
nity of idolS, and the wor-
shipping of images, that
we have in all the Bible
besides3 for which very
cause, were it not to pre-
serve the credit of the new
decree at Trent, the Roman
Catholics (many of them)
would be content to put it
out of their canon: but,
since they have brought it
in, and are now bound to
defend it, there let it stand,
as one of their canonized
witnesses against them-

selves.

The Breviary of
the Roman Church ap-

fourth books of Esdras:

Church acknowledgeth to
be apocryphal
