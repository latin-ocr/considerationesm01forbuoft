C 1} A P. when,they say “that the Gloss, by the reason which it here

gives for excluding these books from the canon of Scripture,
may as well exclude the books of Job and the JudgeS, be-
cause it is not certainly known who was the author of them.”
For the Gloss intended, not only to apply that uncertainty
to the simple and bare names of the authorsq, but to their
condition and quality3 because the Church was not certain,
whether they, that wrote these later and controverted books,
had the inspiration of God's Spirit to guide them, as we are
sure the writers of the canonical books of Scripture had, who-
ever they were that penned them. For thus are we taught to
understand them, both by the Ordinary Gloss beforer, and by
other doctors of the Church hereafterS.

CXLI. Little reason is there in this exception, that Driedo
and Andradius took against Semeca: but the reason, that
the Gregorian and Cardinal Censurers of his Gloss have given
against him, is much worse. For they have nothing else to
say, but that the council of Trent hath decreed to make these
books canonicalt, which he and the consent of the Church in
his time accounted to be apocryphal. Of the council at Trent
we shall say enough, when we come in order to it hereafter.
In the mean while there was no such decree or council in
Semeca's age, who proposed the common and received doc=·
trine of his own time.
