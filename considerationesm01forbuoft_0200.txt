manner of Scriptum, and carried a greater authority with
them than the books of the Maccabees did, or any such
ecclesiastical writings as were like unto them. Else, why
did he not absolutely say that they were canonical? which
had made an end of the business on the Donatists' side, with-.
out any more ado.

But what his belief was concerning these books hath been
declared before, in a work of his that he wrote towards the
end of his days: wherein he severeth and excludethy the
Maccabees, and other such Church-books, from those Scrip-
tures that are called canonical: acknowledging, nevertheless‚
that, in some respect, the Church affordeth them that appel-
lation. For in one and the same respect this can never be
intended 3 unless we shall make S. Augustine to contradict
himself in the very same period, or the Church to hold those
books canonica] which are not within the canonical Scrip-
tures. For the avoiding of which contradiction, we must of
force suffer S. Augustine to explain his own words, and to
add (as he doth there) the reason why the Church called
them canonicalz, and in what sense she did so, that is to say,
not because the authors of them were prophets, or men in-
spired by God to write and give us the rules of our Faith, but
in regard of the many picus directions and examples of zeal
aud constancy in religion, that are there to be found: for
which cause³ the Church received them into the lower canon
of ecclesiastical books, but not into the supreme canon of
absolute and divine Scriptures. According to which distinc-¹
tion, also, the Hellenist Jews held them to be as canonica]
as any Christian Church did: for from those Jews only the
Christians received them, and not from the Hebrews b.
