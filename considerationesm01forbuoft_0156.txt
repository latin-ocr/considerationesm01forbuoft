C HAP- to the prejudice of those pieces that are annexed to Daniel:
VI. in his preface upon Tobit, he revoketh what he had elsewhere
affirmed concerning the perfectiori of the Hebrew canon: in
his prologue upon J udith, and in his exposition of the
Psalms, he retracteth what he said before against the book
of Judith: and in his commentary upon Esay, he amend-
eth his former judgment concerning the MaccabeeS. As
much, likewise, do they objectX against him for the books

of Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus. ’

LXXIII. But all these exceptions will not serve their
turn 3 and there is not one of them that is of force enough
to invalidate S. J erome's former testimonies.

1. For, first, the exception which they make concerning the
canon of the Hebrews (whereunto they would have his words
so to relate, as if that canon were different from the canon of
the Christian Church) is but a vanity of those men that know
not what else to say. For, besides S. J erome’sy own express
words to the contrary, we have the acknowledgment of Car-
dinal Bellarmine himself2‚ that herein S. Jerome can be no
otherwise taken, than to have declared his mind as well con-
cerning the canon of the Church as the account and rule of
the synagogue3 which, for the Old Testament, ought not to
vary one from the other. Nor was it then, oris it now, 111
the power of all the Churches in the world to make any book
canonica] to the Christiana, which had not been formerly so
