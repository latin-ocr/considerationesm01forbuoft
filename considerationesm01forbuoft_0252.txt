c HAP. in our Public Confession or Articles of Religion. For, in his
X. Commentary upon the Revelation‘g he reduceth the books of
the Old Testament to the same number, wherein both Ter-
tullian, S. Jerome, and Primasius, with others above cited,
had represented them before 3 and in his Commentaries upon
the Kingsx he doth as much 3 elsewhere making no other
division of themy, than into those three classes (commonly
received by the Hebrews) of l. The Law, 2. The Prophets,
and 3. The Hagiographa. Resides, in his book of the Six
Ages of the World, he followeth the account of Eusebius2,
(afore mentioned,) and remarkably distinguisheth the books
of the Maccabees from the Divine Scripture, coupling them
with the writings of J osephus, and Julius the African 3
which is an evident argument, that he reckoned them not
to be canonical. And, though he allegoriseth the History of
Father Tobit, (as he calls it,) where, if he had held it to be
a book of canonical Scripture, he might have taken occasion
enough to have said it, yet, in all his discourse there, he
speaketh not a word to any such purpose. His commen-
taries upon Genesis and the Kings were sometimes falsely
attributed to Eucherius, the bishop of Lyons, and, howso-
ever Andrew Schott imagined that neither he nor Bede was
the author of them ³, yet we have more reason to believe the
