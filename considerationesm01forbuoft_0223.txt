eanonical, no more than Gelasius and his bishops did 3 who
must either be taken in such a latitude as wc desire to be, or

the thing itself, (to say, that any book was a canonical book
of the Old Testament, which during the time of that Testa-

Rome, reaching it over to Pope Eugenius in his couneil at
Florence, (which is a leap no less than nine hundred and fifty
years long,) and Pope Eugenius putting it into the hands of
the eouncil of Trent. We shall speak with the eouncil of
Florence *, and Trent †, hercaftcr 3 and, what all the rest of
this show can say, we have already heard before, and heard
