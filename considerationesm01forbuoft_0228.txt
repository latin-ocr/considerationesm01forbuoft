CHAPTER VIII.

THE TESTIMONOES OF THE ANCIENT ECCLESIASTICAL WRITERS IN THE
SIXTH CENTURY.

LXXXIX. M. Aurelius Cassiodore, (sometimes a senator
of Ravenna, and consul of Rome, but afterwards one that re-
tired himself to a collegiate life in a religious housem which
he had built for that purpose,) though he lived many years
in the former century, yet in his old age reached to this, and
wrote an introduction to the reading of divine Scriptures.
Among which he comprehendeth not only the canonical, but
the ecclesiastica] books also of the Bible, together with the
best expositors ss and tractates that had been made upon
them. In the first place, he reciteth the stricter catalogue
of S. Hierome0, (which is an argument that he preferred it
before any other,) and afterwards the larger enumeration of
S. Augustine and the common Septuagint3 but of these two
last his judgment is not so well known to us, as otherwise it
might have been, if the copies of his writing had come perfect
to our hands. For they that set him forth confess somewhat
here to be wanting. In the mean while, how highly he ap-
proved S. J erome's edition, which consisted of twenty-two
books according to the Hebrew canon, he declareth at large:

est plane S. Hieronymum ideo diver-
sorum translationes legisse, atque cor-
rexisse, eo quod auctoritati Hebraicae
nequaquam eas perspiceret consonare.
Unde factum est ut omnes libros V. T.
diligenti cura in Latinum sermonem

viginti duarum literarum modum, qui
apud Hebraeos manet, competenter ad-
duceret, per quas omnis sapientia dis-
