PREFACE.

THE “ Scholastical History of the Canon of the Holy
Scriptures,'' contained in the present volume, was first pub*
lished in London, A.D. 1657, during the author’s retirement
and residence in Paris. It was reprinted in London, A.D.
16723 and again, A.D. 1683. Except in the spelling, these
three impressions are precisely alike. The editor has followed
the first, comparing it throughout with the second.

In preparing this volume for the preSS, some difficulties
have been met with, arising partly out of the wide range
occupied by the numerous writers whose testimonies had to
be verified3 partly from the author’s having derived his ex-
tracts, not always from the original works themselves, but
apparently very often from summaries and abridgments 3
and, again, in part also from his frequent practice of ab·
stracting the sense of long original passages, so as to express
their meaning in eomparatively few words, many of which
are probably his own.

In all such cases it has been thought advisable to produce
the original passages at length, and (where practicable) with
their context: nor, where the work was scarce, or curious,
or otherwise of special valne, has the editor scrupled to risk
the charge of occasional prolixity.

It is a matter of regret, that, in several minor iustances,
the passages referred to in this work have not been found,
owing, perhaps, generally to some mistake in the reference.
But, in these cases, it has been thought worth while to pro-
duce parallel passages, (where such could be met with‚) in
order to verify, out of the same author, the particular asser-
tion or argument employed by Bishop Cosin. It should be
stated also, that, in a very few instanees‚ our best libraries
have failed to supply a single copy of some particular work
referred to in this Scholastica] History.
