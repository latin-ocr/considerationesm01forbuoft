books of Tobit, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Baruch, and
the Maccabees, besides some chapters of Daniel and Esther.
But there were certain persons among them, (of whom Ca-
tharin was the chief, who made it a main part of his business
to oppose the writings of Cardinal Cajetan), that would needs
have them all declared to be, in all parts, as they stand in
the Latin Bible, of divine and equal authority: only the
book of Baruch troubled them, which was never put into the
number, either by the Pope, or the council of Carthage3 but
howsoever, because it was sometimes read in the Church, this
alone was thought reason enough by them to have it made
canonical. And, in the end, the voices of these men, with
some others that were got to be of their faction, (though by
divers of the more learned sort there confronted), made the
maj0r part of XLIII., or some few persons more, and pre-
vailed for an oecumenical decree of all the Bishops in the
world.

receive, with equal veneration, all the books of the Old and
New Testament, together with the unwritten traclitions be-

mouth of Christ, or dictated by the Holy Ghost : ..... that,
among these books, Tobit and J udith, WVisdom and Eccle-
siasticus, Baruch and the Maccabees, together with the parts
of Daniel and Esther, ought to be numbered 3 . . . . . and that,
if any person doth not receive them all, as sacred and cano-
nical, . . . . let him be accursed.''

written traditionS, is no less against the truth, and against
