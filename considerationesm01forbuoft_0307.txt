certain, either who wrote them, or by what spirit they were
written, or whether all things that are contained in them be
undoubtedly true, others, that, besides all these uncertain-
ties, have many things in them either manifestly false, or
shrewdly suspected so to be: both which sorts of books
being excluded from the canon of Scripture, the Church
pcrmitteth the one to be read, but giveth not the like liberty
for the other. And, among those that are thus permitted‚
and yet not received into the canon, he reckoneth expressly
the six apocrypha] books, which, since his time, the Pope
and a few Bishops at Trent have commanded, upon peril of
their curse and damnation, to be canonical, and so to be re-
ceived, in despite of all Churches and all people, before and
after them, in the world.

CLXIII. Yet this is not the only place, wherein this
great and eminent writer declareth the common voice of
the Catholic Church to be against them. For elsewhere 1115
sayings are as clear to the same purpose: as, where he dc-
nieth any of those apocryphal books¹¹¹ (though they be
written and read together with the other books of the Bible)
to be received by the Church into the like authority with
those that are authentica] and canonical.
fore may be objected out of his Commentary upon S. Jeromc's
prologue to Paulinusn, concerning the reception of these
books into the Church, cannot be otherwise understood, tliau
of such a reception that took them only into the Bible, to be
read among Christiaus, (which was moreO than the chrews
would allow them,) as usually they were, both in their private
5111111115, and in their public offices 3 which is an honour that
we dcny them not.
