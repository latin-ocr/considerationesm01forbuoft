censure of the copy printed at Basil, in the words here cited τεετ. or
at the margin0. For the words of the son of Sirach have (ἷῐξζῖῐζῗῖ
very little or no agreement with the discourse of Josephus:

the one speaking hyperbolically of the malice and wicked-

ness of a womanp, but the other only of the inferiority and
subjection to her husbandq, whereunto the law of Moses had Gen. 3. 16.
most justly obliged her. Indeed χείρων (which is the word

that Josephus useth) signifieth sometimes more wiclsed or

worse, and sometimes 2‘nferz'0r; and this was it which de-

ceived his interpreter, who took it in the first sense, when

he should have taken it in the latter. For so the old version [vigi. not.
of Ruffinus took it: since whose time those words that now 2234}ss-
follow in Josephus, concerning the wickedness of a woman, ρία αὐτοῦ

 

 

have been added to his text by some bold and inconsiderate
transcriber of his book 3 herein peradventure following some '‘⁶5-
mistaken reader, or other, that to the word χείρων had
noted the saying of Ecclesiasticus in his margin, without
any further regard had to the true intent and scope at which

J osephus aimed.

man that doth ill, than a woman doing
well.'' [The words of our authorized
version are: “Better is the churlish-
ness of a man than a courteous woman,
a woman, I say, which bringeth shame
and reproach.'’ In the Lat. Vulg. Ed.
the words are: “Melior est iniquitas
viri quain mulier benefaciens, et inu-
lier confundens in opprobrium.” In
the LXX the passage stands: κρείσ-
