xm. and the order of them was somewhat altered, (as in divers
respects they may well be,) but the books were still the

Jews from their captivity 111 Babylon, all the books of the
Scripture, having been revised by Ezrat, (then their priest
and their leader,) who digested themu likewise into those
several classes before rehearsed, were by him, and the pro-
phets of God that lived with him, consigned and delivered
over to all posterity. But this is sure,—that, after his age
Haggaiand and the time of the Prophet Malachi, (who was one among
Zachary those that prophesied in that time,) there were 110 more pro—

the Baptist, and therefore no more prophetical and divine
Scriptures between them.

time of Esdras, the same and so many being accurately pre-
served by the Jews, and continuing among them unto the
time of our blessed Saviour, (as they do likewise still unto
this very day,) without any addition, imminution, or altera-
tion, descended to the Christians.
