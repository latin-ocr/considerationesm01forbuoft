not contested ς 1101· would they have added their anathema
against all men that were otherwise minded. How those two
Popes, together with S. AugustineZ and the African couneil,
are to be understood, and taken in that sense which may not
contradict both themselves and the universal doctrine of the
Church in their times, and in all times before them, we have
at large set forth in their own ages: nor can any thing be
brought more to the purpose, or better and more truly to
expound them, than the judgment of Tostatus, and Cardinal
Cajetan, who, for the happiness and depth of their under-
standing, as likewise for their admirable industry and dili-
gence, were accounted the prime Divines of those times
wherein they lived, and many more ages besides; being so
well read in the Scriptures‚ together with the ancient and
later doctors, whom they had studied from their childhood,
that there was 110 prelate or person in the council of Trent,
who might have thought himself too good to learn of them.
And if, in this little new council and deeree, they had pro-
ceeded 110 further than S. Augustine, or the Africans and
Innocent did, there might have been some tolerable sense
and explication given of it: whereas, by the terms wherein
they have now addressed it, they have left the world no way,
either to reconcile it to the former, or to render it sufferable
to the future ages of the Church. For, whosoever receiveth
this eouncil of Trent, he must not only receive the contro-
verted and additional books of the Old Testament, as per-
mitted to be read for instruction and good examples of man-
ners, (which was all that ever the Church allowed to tl1em‚)
but he must likewise take and believe them, under pain of
eternal damnation, to be in all parts equal, and of like au-
thority, to the writings of Moses and the Prophets, for the
establishing of his Faith, and founding the main points of
his religion upon them 3 and, (which is more,) must not only
believe so himself, but be bound also to believe, that every
one is damnedst, who doth not herein believe as much as he,
