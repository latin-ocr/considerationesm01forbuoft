C H A P. yet whether, in the very Articles of Fami, some certain say-
1. ings that are found in those books (agrecable herein to the
others that are canonical) may not be brought for the more
abundant explaining and clearing of them 2—-for all this we
grant: and to all these purposes there may be good use
made of an Apocryphal book z——but the question only is,
whether all or any of those books be purely, positively, and
simply Divioze Scriptum, or to all purposes and in all senses
sacred and canonical, so as that they may be said (or were
ever so accounted) to be of the same equal and sovereign
authority with the rest, for the establishing and determining
of any matter of saith, or controversy in religion, no less
than the true and undoubted canonical books of Scripture

XV. And in this sense what books were anciently received
into the canon, and what were not, we are to enquire in
order3 of them first, whom it first concerned to know them
perfectly5 and then of others, that received the just number
of them, and so delivered them over to posterity. For thus
doth every nation take knowledge of their own peculiar laws
and histories that belong unto them: of which as there is no
better assurance to be had, than the records of those times
wherein they were first enrolled, and the joint testimony of
those persons who then lived upon the place, so, in our
present case, they that were the nearest both in regard of
time and place, to the first writing and delivery of those
books which God then committed to the custody and care
of His Church, ought certainly, before all others, to be of
most credit with us in giving their testimony unto them.

XVI. To make it therefore undeniably appear, that the
Church of England, together with all other reformed and
Christian Churches abroad, are better observers of this
Scripture-canon than the Church of Rome now is: ].. We
are first to enquire of the ancient J udaical Church, which
received the canonical books of the Old Testament from
Moses and the Prophets: 2. And then of the Christian
Church, which received the books both of the Old Testament
and the New from Christ and His holy Apostles. For the
Oracles under the Old Testament had their period with the
prophets, and under the New spake no more after the time
