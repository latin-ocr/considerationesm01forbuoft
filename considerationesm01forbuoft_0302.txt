CLX. And this (forsooth) is the canon of the oecumenica}
eouneil of Florenee‚ that Canusffl, and Becanusss, and many
others0‚ bring against us. For from Caranza they had it,
and from nobody else3 who, it is most likely, had it from
some impostor or other, that made this deeree of his own
head, when there was no copy of the eouncil to be found
that had the like. Though‚ if it were true,—all this that
Caranza added to it,—-yet in the same sense that S. Augus-
tine, and the couneil of Carthage, were interpreted before,
may these words of the epitome be taken here. But 111
epitomes of eouncils there ought not to be more, than is
in the great and vast volumes of the 6011116113 themselves3
where no such thing is to be seen, in all the several editions
that have been printed of them. And, as for the couneil of
Florenee itself, the story of it (which we have briefly and
truly represented) hath made it manifest, that it cannot be
rightly accounted to be a general or an oeeumenieal eouncil,
were it but in respect of the Latin Churehes alone 3 whereof
a great part remained at Basil, and aeknowledged not either
