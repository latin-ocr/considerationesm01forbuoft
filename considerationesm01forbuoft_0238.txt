Solomon to be the author of no other books but those
three, which we properly receive for his, and number among
the true canonical Scriptures. (2.) For eluding the autho-
rity, or testimony, produced out of S. Gregory against the
canonizing of the MaccabeeS, Monsieur du Perron, or those
that magnify his Reply to King J ames most, may not think
to carry it away from us by saying, that S. Gregoryh, when
he began first to write his Morals upon J ob, was but yet a
simple deacon, and not Bishop or Pope of Rome, being at
that time employed as Nuncio at Constantinople among the
Greeks. For, first, if the Maccabees and the like books had
been held and believed to be canonical Scriptures at Rome,
(as Cardinal Perron supposed here they were, both at Rome,
and all the Wes‘cern Church over,) it is no way probable, that
S. Gregory, who had all his life-time before been brought up
and instructed in that Church, would have changed his belief
so lightly, as soon as he came into the Eastern Church among
the Greeks at Constantinople3 which had been at least a dis-
sembling in him, and no upright walking according to truth.
But he, that durst there oppose Eutychius the patriarchi,
and defend another point of true belief against him, would
never (sure) have suppressed or dissembled this at Constan-
tinople, if he had known it to be an article or a principle of
their faith at Rome 3 where we may therefore safely con-
clude that no such article was at that time believed. Nor
will it serve the CardinaPs turn here to say, “ that S. Gregory
was but a simple (leacon, when he began first to write these

his Morals in the East ;'’ for
