CVII. Photius in the beginning of his Bibliotheque telleth
use, that among other books he had read an Introduction to
the Holy Scriptures, written by a certain known author in
those times under the name of Adrian 3 and he commendeth
the book to them that study the knowledge of the Bible. At
the beginning of this last agef, this book was set forth at
Auspurg. And, though we find no express catalogue in it of
the canonica] books of Scripture recited in their order, yet,
the testimonies that he bringeth out of the Scriptures being
very many, we find never a one produced out of those books
that be now in debate 3 which is an evident sign that he held
them not to be any parts of canonical Scripture. We add this
author to the end of this century 3 for, if Photius read him, A.D.760‚

he was at least so ancient, if he lived not in the age before. &ug-circi-
