of Christ’s disciples. And what writing soever it be, that PREFACE.
hath not first been received and delivered by them as pro- *aaa
perly belonging to the undoubted canon of divine Seripture,
[it] cannot either by any tract of time, or by all the power
under heaven, be made canonical: which is so great and so
irrefragable a truth, that Cardinal Bellarmine himself is
forced to confess itm, even in his greatest heat and 01)-
position against us. Nor can his evasion here serve him to
any purpose, to say, that, ‘though the Church may not at
her own pleasure make a book canonical which was not so
before, yet, by virtue of some ancient testimonies, she may
declare it to be canonical,' (as the Church of Rome hath
lately done‚) for all after-ages to receive it. For, as it shall
appear by this following discourse, that those ancient testi-
monies are but pretended, and that none can clearly be pro-
duced to that purpose, (they being made, both by him and
others, to speak that which they never meant‚) so, if any
such might be brought, yet would they stand him (or the
Church of Rome) in no stead at all, for the addition of any
new books to the Old Testament, (which are the books now
only in controversy.) For having formerlyn acknowledged,
as he doth often after⁰‚ that the Church of the Jews had 110
such books in their Bible‚ that is, neither more nor less than
we have in ours, (wherein he says very true,) all the testi-
monies that he can pretend to bring against it, will bc
brought against the truth and himself both: there being
