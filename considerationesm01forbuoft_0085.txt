But whom shall the J esuit persuade that the Apostles cnm. ¹'

copies had as much in them of old as the Latin hath now,

yet who would believe that S. Paul and S. J ames alluded

rather to the book of J udith than to the book of Numbers, Num. 11.

XXXIX. For the books of Tobit and Baruch‚ or for the
additions to Esther and Daniel, I find not any allegations
produced out of the New Testament, whereby to give them
the authority of canoniea] Scriptures. A few resemblances
of phrases and expressions there are in many places between
them, (as between Tob. iv. 7. and Luke xi. 41. “ Give alms of
thy substance ;’' Tob. iv. 12. and 1 Thess. iv. 3. “Beware of

devils, and not unto G-od 3³²) but, if resemblances of words

be any reason to make these books canonieal, by the same

reason we should have more eanonical books yet than the

canon of Trent will allow. For the prayer of Manasses,
together with the third and fourth book of Esdras, that

canon rejecteth out of the eanonical number, as well as we 3
