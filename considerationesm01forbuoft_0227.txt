both in regard of the books themselves, and of the times
when they were first set forth, which was after Ezra and
Malaohi had closed up the canon. Again, if Innocent's re· Vide chap.
script had then carried the present Roman sense, and been {pugn} iv.
of such authority as is now pretended, how came it to pass,
that from the next ages after him, to the time of the council
of Trent itself, there was no greater regard and consideration
had of it? For certain it is, that, from this time to curs,
never was any Bible found, that had either his epistle, or the
catalogue of S. Augustine, or the canon of Carthage, or the
decree of Gelasius, set before it: as in all, manuscript and
printed, the prologue of S. Hierome is there placed by aProLGa3
common and universal consent of the Latin Church, to be ξῗζζξῗῇῗμ
a sure index and discrimination of the apocryphal or eccle-
siastical books from the canonicalh. For herein he was pre-
ferred before all other writersi that spake not so distinctly
and exactly of this particular as he did. And, to make it
manifest that, in the subsequent ages, the Church followed
not the pretended definition of Innocent or Gelasius, but the
distinction that S. J erome made, and the ancient canon that
the Christians received from the Hebrews ¹³, we shall, in the
chapters ensuing, take a full view of the next ages, and see
the testimonies which both the elder and the later writers

have given us herein.
