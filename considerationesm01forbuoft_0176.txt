storiesc or no, as that they might not be suffered to come
into the ecclesiastical class of Scriptures, and were altogether
unfit to bc read in the Church. This Ruffinus apprehended
to be S. J erome's meaning, and therein mistook him. For,
though the J ewsd were of that mind, yet S. J erome was not:
who had only saide, that these pieces were no true parts of
Daniel's Prophecy, and that they had not the same authority
with the canonical Scriptures. Nor can there any more be
made of this difference between them. 5. To the last ob-

VVisdom as a prophecy, when he said, in his treatise upon
the Symbol, that now it would be no hard thing to believe
what the prophets had foretoldf, that “the just shall shine
as the sun, and as the brightness of the firmament, in the
kingdom of God,'') we say that, as it is not credible Ruffin
would contradict himself so soon, and quote that author for
a prophet whom he had already, in the same treatise, ex-
cluded out of the number of the prophets, so he nameth
not the book of Wisdom here at all; and there is little re-
semblance between his words and the words of that book:
which if such a phrase as this (‘ the just shall shine') were
sufficient to make canonica] Scripture, the fourth book of
Esdras would be as canonical as it; for there also we read
as much as this phrase importeth. But there is enough be-
sides, in the canonical books themselves, to verify Ruffin's
citation 3 which is clearly drawn from the Prophecy of
