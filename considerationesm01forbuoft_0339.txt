the Canon of the Scriptures. 281

CXCV ΙΙ. For which their doings herein they have nothing consen,
to plead. For either must they plead the common testimony AT mmm.
of the Church before them, or a peculiar revelation given
them to this purpose by God Himself, or the special power
of their own Church, to alter and advance the former con-
dition of the books (now debated) at their pleasure. But,
first, the testimony of the Catholic Church, whereby this
controversy, (to manifest the perpetual tradition, or matter
of fact in it,) ought to be decided, is altogether against them,
—as we have produced and proved it in every age, both
under the Old Testament, and under the New. Then, to
any special revelation, that they had about this matter, they
do not pretend themselves 3 nor are there any such new
revelations given in these times, (and where they are pre-
tended, they are never to be admitted,) which be opposite to
the ancient rules of verity and religion received by the
Church of God in all times heretofore. And, for the power
that they had at Trent to regulate either their own Church
01· any other, in things of this nature,——as we know none
they have, so is it their own confession that none they ought
to haveb3-challenging no other power in this particular,
than only to declare what books were truly and properly
canonical in the Church before, and not to make them so,
otherwise than God had formerly both made and declared
the perfect canon of His Scriptures to their hands.

CXCVIII. When they cannot tell else what to say, they
are (some of them) content now to let the books, (promiscu-
ously numbercd in one general catalogue,) be distributed
into two several ranks of a first and a second canone. And
