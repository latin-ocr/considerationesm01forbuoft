CHAPTER ΙΙ.

THE TESTIMONY OF THE ANCIENT JUDAICAL CHURCH.

XVII. The honour and privilege, which the posterity of
Jacob sometimes had above all the world besides, was to be
that peculial· people of God‚ to whom He was pleased to
make His laws and His Scriptnres known: nor was there
then any other Church but theirS, or any other oracles of
God than what were committed to them. For they had all
that were then extant P, and all written in their own lan-
guage.

XVIII. These they divided into three several classes:
whereof the first comprehended the five books of Moses3
the second all the prophets3 and the third those writings
which they called the Chethubim, or books that were written
by the holy men of God who were not so properly to be
ranked among the prophets: from whom both the five books
of Moses and these Chethubim were distinguished, because,
howsoever they were all written by the same prophetical
spirit and instinct which the books of the prophets were,
yet—Moses having been their special lawgiver, and the
writers of these other books having had no public mission
01· office of prophetS, (for some of them were kings, and
others were great and potent persons in their times,)—-they
gave either of them a peculiar class by themselves.

XIX. In this division, as they reckoned five books in the
first class, so in the second they counted eight, and in the
third nine,—-two and twenty in all‘l z—-in number equal to
