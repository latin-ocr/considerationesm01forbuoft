the Canon of the Smffptures. 243

or, at least, that some other synod was held at Florence
(when this was ended) in the month of December, at what
time the decree of the Pope is dated. 'Wherein Eugenius,
(if his decree be not rather counterfeit,) whatsoever he was
pleased to say and to command besides, saith never a word,
all the while, concerning the canonical books of Scripture,
or in what number, one or other, they are to be received.
CLIX. In the large tomes, and editions of the Councils,
which Crab, Surius, Nicolinus, the Vatican, and Binius have
set forth, there are in this decree of Pope Eugenius but eight
articles: nor did all the librariesh, whereinto they could
make search, by themselves or others, afford them any more:
only Caranzai, and out of him Longus Coriolanus, have in
their epitomes of the councils given us nine or ten 3 (but in
such an order and manner, as the two last articles, given us
in the larger volumes, are by them omitted, and three others
substituted in their room3) the seventh whereof (which is
not at all found in the tomes of the Councilsk neither) is an
extravagant cencerning the Manichees3 from the naming of
whom occasion is there pretended to be taken of setting
down “ the books that pertain both to the Old and New Tes-
tament¹ 3⁹³ whereof a catalogue is there likewise given us with
