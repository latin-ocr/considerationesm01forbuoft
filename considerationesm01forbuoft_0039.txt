To THE READER. xxxiii

and testimony of God's Church herein unanimously delivered
in all ages from the Apostles' times (and before) to ours,—my
observations, as Ι pass along both through the ancient and
later writers that have said any thing of this subject, are
many of them new; and, where I have followed others, even
there also Ι have added much of my own, to advance and
manifest the truth that is in them: having no other aim,
than herein to be serviceable to the Truth of Gocl, set forth
and professed by the Church of England3 which Truth we
endeavour, in these wavering and lapsing times, to preserve
entire and upright among us.

My discourse is continued, and not interrupted with quo-
tations of authors3 which I have diligently searched and
placed all the way in the margin. The language, that I
use, is familiar, clear, and inoffensive, (which Ι trust will
make it the more aeceptable :) for Ι neither affect, nor ap-
prove any other.

But, if I may unwittingly have said any thing, that shall
be found to disagree either with any passage in the Holy
Scriptures, or with the consent of antiquity in the sense and
interpretation of those Scriptures, (which yet, I hope well,
will not be found,) Ι do here beforehand revoke and unsay
it already.
