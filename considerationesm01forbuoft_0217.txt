law. And, as this was the original of tho Roman code, so cmw. v.

that code is the first wherein we meet with this decree of
Pope Innocent concerning the ScriptureS, that is, no less
than four hundred years after his death: which is one reason
why we do the more suspect it. (2.) Another is, because in
this matter the council of Carthage 2, being not altogether
so sure of their canon, intended to consult their brother
Pope Boniface, and other bishops that lived abroad, about it3
which they needed never to have done, if Pope Innocent had
sent out any such decree before. For it is pretended, that
this decree was out fourteen years before the time of that
council and Pope Boniface. (3.) And a third is, because we
find those words of the Apostle in it, “ They that are in the Rom. 8. 8.
flesh cannot please God,” so grossly misapplied to persons that

live in marriage. But after all this, if we should grant this

epistle to be true, and allow it as much authority as the two

popes did in Gratian's canon lawa, yet will the same answer

to it be sufficient, which we gave before to the authority of

S. Augustino, and the council of Carthage. And somewhat Num

book of Tobit to be found, as neither in S. Augustine's cata-
logue, nor in the canon of Carthage, shall we find the book
