rejected Esay and Daniel, than Tobit and Judith. In one
psalm of David, in one chapter of Esay, there is more said
concerning our Saviour against the Jews, than in all these
controverted books put together 3 and it cannot be well
imagined, that they would reject these books which did
thern no hurt, and retain those which made most against
them, but that the one was true Scripture which they durst
not reject, and the other was none, which they had never
received. For, fourthly, had these other ever been parts
of the canonica] Scriptures, it had been a wicked sacrilege
in the Jews to reject them, and Christ, that so often and so
sharply reprehended these men for taking away the true
sense of the Scriptures,—would He not much more have
condemned them, and laid so great a crime to their charge,
if they had taken likewise away any parts (or whole books)
of the Scriptures themselves? But, in that neither He nor
His Apostles ever aceused them of any such sacrilege, it is
as good as a clear evidence to us that they never committed
it. Fifthly, and lastly, in what langnage were they first
written? For all the canonical books of the Old Testament
were originally written in HebreW, (except a few parts only
of Daniel and Ezras, written in the Chaldee dialect, where-
unto the Jews during the time of their captivity in Babylon
had been accustomed 3) but these other books were all con-
fessedly first written in the Greek tongue, which was sor the
use of the Hellenists or dispersed Jews abroad, and not for
them that dwelt at Jerusalem or 111 Palestine at home, where
it was but little understood, and where those books were so
far from being received into their Scriptures, that they were
never publicly read, or admitted into their synagogues.
XXVI. What therefore was not canonical to them, cannot
be (as any part of the Old Testament) canonical to us. For
it implies a contradiction, that a book should be canonical
under the Old Testament, and yet under that Testament
should never be taken into the canon, nor numbered among
those books that were then only received and believed to
be canonica13 of which nature and account these contro-
verted books must have truly been, or else it is not the vote
of a few persons in the council of Trent, nor of all the world
