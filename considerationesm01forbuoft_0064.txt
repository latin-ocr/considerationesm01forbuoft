VI. Those books, therefore, which were thus delivered to
God's Church at first, as His undoubted word and verity,
whereby all points of saith and religion are for ever to be
ordered, ought still to be retained, and no more to be added
to them in either of these two Testaments.

VII. And to know exactly what the true number and
names of those books are which belong to them both, there
is no safer course to be taken, than herein to follow the
public voice and the universal testimony of the same Church;
which, from hand to hand receiving those books into the
divine and authentic canon of Scripture, hath brought them
down from the times of Moses and the prophets to the time
of Christ and His Apostles, and so from their time to ours
successively in all ages.

VIII. For, though there be many interna] testimonies
belonging to the Holy Scriptures, whereby we may be suf-
ficiently assured that they are the true and lively Oracles of
God, such as be,—the height and majesty of the things
there delivered above all other conceptions and writings in
the world: the perpetual analogy and conformity of all the
several parts therein contained, one with another: the great-
ness and dignity of those prophecies which be there foretold 5
and the truth or certainty of them all, which be there ful-
filled: together with the divine power and providence, that
hath confirmed and preserved them to all posterity : besides
the spiritual force and efficaeyf‚ (which is never there want-

f S. Chrysost. Orat. 24. in Genes.
Dominum benignum habemus. Et
ubi viderit nos sollicitos esse, et mag-
num desiderium ad Divina Oracula
intelligenda adferre, non permittit nos
ulla re indigere, sed statim illustrat in-
tellectum nostrum, et illuminationem
suain largitur, quodque sapientiae ejus
proclive est, universam illam veram

Doctrinam menti nostrae inserit. [S.
Chrysostom's words are: καὶ ’γὰρ φι-
λάνθρωπον ἔχομεν Δεσπότην, καὶ ἐπει-
δὰν ἴδῃ μεριμνῶντας ἡμᾶς, κα). πόθον
πολὺν ἐπιδεικνυμένους πρὸς τὴν τῶν
Θείων Λογῖων κατανόησιν, οὐκ ἀφίησιν
ἑτέρου τινὸς δεηθῆναι, ἀλλ’ εὐθέως φω-
τίζει τὸν ἡμέτερον λογισμὸν, καὶ τὴν
παρ’ Αὐτοῦ ἔλλαμψιν χαρίζεται, καὶ,
κατὰ τὴν εὐμήχανον αὐτοῦ σοφίαν, πᾶ-
σαν τὴν ἀληθῆ διδασκαλίαν ἐντίθησι
τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ψυχῇ-Ἔφη. iv. p. 216;
