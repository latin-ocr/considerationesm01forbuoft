but many times also they would lay violent hands upon their
own personS‚ and either murder themselves, or threaten other
persons with present death, if those persons would not do it
for them, when they were in danger to be taken, and punished
by the law which the secular powers had then made against
them. And this they called their martyrdom 3 teaching and
exhorting all their followers rather to destroy themselves,
or to kill one another, than to suffer any public shame‚ or
punishment, as common malefactors. For which impious
phrensy and madness of their sect, being generally con-
demned by all other men, and challenged by S. Augustine
to shew any allowance or example in Scripture for it, they
had none to bring but the example of Baziasp in the Mac-
cabees 3 who, to avoid the fury of his enemies, made an end
of himself, and, being enfiamed with anger against them,
plucked out his own bowels. Whereupon S. Augustine took
occasion to declare his judgment concerning that book of the
Maccabees, and said the Donatists were hard driven, that
they had no other Scripture or ecclesiastical authorityq to
shew for themselves. And, though he denieth not but that
Razias was to be commended for a man of great resolution
and valour, yet he admits him not to be a martyr sor his
religion, or (in this particular fact of self-homicide) to be set
forth as any example, that might be followed by the Dona-
tists, or other persons whatsoever. But, perceiving that this
answer would not satisfy those men, who defended them-
selves herein by the credit and authority that the book of
the Maccabees had among the AfricanS, he proceedeth yet
further, and lesseneth the authority of that book by a triple
testimony: first, by the testimony of the J udaical Church‘,
