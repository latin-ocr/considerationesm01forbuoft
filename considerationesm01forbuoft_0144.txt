86 Α Scholastical History of

the “ authentic, true, and genuine books of Holy Scripture 3³³
making the Hebrew canon of the Old Testament to be the
rule and square, that herein the Christians are to follow3
and counting only twenty-two books, whereof he numbereth
twelve to be historical, and five metrical, and five prophe-
tical, naming them all in their order, but making no
mention at all of Tobit and Judith, or those that follow
in the new catalogue, which can therefore have no other
place in his account than among thoset that are not canon-
icalu or legitimate parts of the Bible. Against this evident
testimony of S. Nazianzen there is nothing objected, but l.
that he omitteth the book of Estherx, which we have an-
swered before 3 and 2. that he allegeth the book of Wisd0mv‚
which nevertheless will not make it canonica13 and 3. that
these verses, and all this catalogue of the true Scriptures, is
“ falsely imposed upon him⁷¹;” which never any man said be-
fore Cardinal Perron, who durst venture for a shift to say any
thing. But we have little reason to believe him upon his
own word, wherein we find him so often failing.

LXVII. Conform to the testimony of S. Basil and S. Gre-
gory Nazianzen is the canon of S. Amphilochius, the metro-
politan bishop of Iconium in Lycaonia, an intimate friend to
them both, and one of the Fathers that met together in the
second general council. S. J erome saysa that, of these three
bishops‚ he knows not which he should admire most, their
secular learning, or their knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.
The Epistle of Amphilochius is extantb, written to Seleucus
