CHAP. in S. Augustine himself 3 who, though he were present at
VI. the council of Carthage, (hereafter to be considered,) yet did

never imagine (as these men do) that the canon of Scripture 1
was never determined before the time of that council 3 but he ’

but in a seigned letter written to that purposed, and in
lllonsieur Du Perron, who never read any such retractation
in S. Jerome himself. (1.) For, first, in his Apology against
Ruffin concerning the histories of Susanna and Bel, which in
his preface upon Daniel he had said before to be esteemed

so far was he from retracting what he had said, that he says
