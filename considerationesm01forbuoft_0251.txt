the Canon of the Scriptures. 193

contrary to the J eWS, Damaseen never said, nor any thing to
that purpose. More sincere are they (but now before cited)
who acknowledge it to be most true, that herein Damascen
and the Jews were both of one mind. The excuse which
Canusr here pretendeth to make for him, (as if the matter
had never yet been determined in the Church before Damas-
cen's time, what books were canonical,) is altogether vain:
for both the J udaical and the Apostolical Church had deter-
min& it, and all the Churches following had submitted to
that determination 3 though, in the mean while, if we should
take Canus at his word, he would be taken by it in his own
snare: for, if the question were not yet determined at the
time when Damascen lived, he cannot with any colour say,
(as he doth often,) that either Innocent, or the Council of
Carthage, or Gelasius, had determined it so long before.
After all this, there is a sermon fathered upon Damascen⁵‚
wherein the books of the Maccabees are said to be divine
scripturos3 but in the same sermon the writings also of
S. Denys are said to be divine and venerable books 3 (which
yet never mais lodged or numbered among the canonica}
parts of the Bible ε) besides, this sermon is so full of fables
and impertinences, that no wise or sober man can ever take
it to be any part of his writing, whose name it beareth:

and yet they have nothing else to bring out of Damascen
against us.
