16 Α Scholastical History of

of J osephus, who lived in the time of the ApostleS, and wrote
the Antiquities of the Jews (of whom he was one himself) in
a most exact and diligent manner. His testimony is so great
in this matter, that it is repeated by Eusebiusc, and put into
his Ecclesiastical History full at length, being to this effect
which followethd z-—That “the Judaical Church had only
twenty-two books of Scripture, which might justly challenge
credit and belief among them 3 whereof five were the books
of Moses, containing little less than three thousand years,-
and thirteen the books of the Prophets, wherein they wrote
the acts of their times from the death of Moses to the reign
of Artaxerxes king of Persia 3 and four more, containing both
hymns to God, and admonitions to men for the amendment
of their lives :—but from the time of Artaxerxes, that, though
certain books had been written, yet they deserved not the
same credit and belief which the former had, because there
was no certain succession of prophets among them: in the
mean while, what belief they had of the true Scriptures
which they only acknowledged, and how faithful they were
towards them, was from hence most manifeste, that, though

[ξ 8. ed. Hudson. et apud Euseb. lib.
iii. cap. lO.] Εἰσὶ παρ’ ἡμῖν δύο μόνα
πρὸς τοῖς εἴκοσι βιβλία, δίο. Sunt nobis
duo tantum et viginti libri totius tem-
poris descriptionem continentes, quibus
merito fides habetur. Horum quinque
Mosis sunt, qni et leges continent, et
humani generis propagationem, et ad
mortem usqueillius extenduntur. Tem-
pus hoc tribus annorum millibus paulo
minus est. A morte vero Mosis usque
ad regnum Artaxerxis, qui post Xerxen
Persarum rex fuit, Prophetae Mose pos-
teriores suorum temporum res gestas
tredecim libris complexi sunt. (These
are the books of Joshua, Judges and
Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Esay, Jeremy
and LamentationS, Ezechiel, the twelve
Prophets, Daniel, Job, Ezras and Ne-
hemias, Esther, and the Chronicles¹.)
Reliqui quatuor hymnos ad Deum, et
admonitiones ad corrigendam homi-
num vitam continent. (These be King
David's Psalter, the Proverbs, Eccle-
siastes, and the Song of Solonion.) Ab
Artaxerxe autern ad nostra usque tem-
pora sunt quidem quaedam scripta, non
tamen ita fide digna sicut praecedentia,

quia non suit certa Prophetarum suc-
cessio.

e Idem, Ib. [ap. Euseb. p. 104]
Res ipsa vero ostendit, quantum nos
Scripturis nostris fidem habeamus:
quum enim tantum interea aevi sit
elapsum, nemo tamen illis vel adjicere
quidquam, vel adimere, vel mutare
ausus est. Nempe omnibus Judaeis
ab ineunte aetate insitum, et quasi in-
natum est, haec Dei Dogmata existi-
mare, inque illis permanere, et pro illis
cupide, si necesse sit, mori. [Neitlier
in this passage, nor in the preceding, has
the Editor discovered the version from
which Cosin takes his extracts. The
original Greek runs thus: (Euseb. Eccl.
Hist. lib. iii. c. 10. Ed. Cantab. 1720.
p. 103.) οὐ μυριάδες οὖν εἰσὶ βιβλίων
παρ’ ἡμῖν ἀσυμφώνων καὶ μαχομένων
δύο δὲ μόνα πρὸς τοῖς εἴκοσι βιβλία, τοῦ
παντὸς ἔχοντα χρόνον τὴν ἀναγραφὴν,
τὰ δικαίως Θεῖα πεπιστευμένα. καὶ τού-

των πέντε μέν ἐστι τὰ Μωϋσέως, ἅ τούς -

πογονῖας παράδοσιν, μέχρι τῆς αὐτοῦ τε-
λευτῆς. οὗτος ὁ χρόνος ἆπυλεῖπει τρι-
σχιλίων ὀλίγον ἐτῶν. ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς Μωϋ-
σέως τελευτῆς μέχρι τῆς Ἀρταξέρξου
τοῦ μετὰ Ξέρξην Περσῶν Βασιλέως, οἱ
μετὰ Μωϋσῆν Προφῆται τὰ κατ’ αὐτοὺς
