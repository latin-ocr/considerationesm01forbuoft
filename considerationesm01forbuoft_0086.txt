XL. But, lastly, for the canonizing of the Maccabees they
produce S. John's testimony: “And it was at Jerusalem
the feast of the dedication ;'' which they say referreth to
1 Mace. iv. 59³.

Yet, first, here is no place of that book quoted3 and
secondly, they had a ‘feast of dedication’ instituted by
Ezra, which might then be kept at Jerusalem. But, be it
understood of the feast that Judas Maccabeus and his
brethren ordained for the dedication of the sanctuaryk,
which Antiochus and his soldiers had profaned‚--the best
that can be made of it is no more than the specifying of a
time which the Jews then observed, and whereat Christ took
occasion to preach and manifest His doctrine to them the
more publicly. But what makes this, either to the citing of
the book, or to the adding of any canonical authority there-
unto? The Jews are said to observe that feast of the dedica-
tion at this day3 and yet they do not acknowledge the books
of the Maccabees to be canonica] Scriptum, no more now
than they did in S. John’s time 3 who, whether he referred
to that Maccabaean dedication or no, is uncertain; but how-
soever to this purpose he mentioned it not: which is the
confession of P. Cotton the Jesuit himselfl. Another ar-
gument they bring from S. Paul⁷s catalogue of instances, in
his Epistle to the Hebrews: where, among other sufferings
that the saints endured, he reckoneth up those that were
“tortured 3²² and, though he nameth no persons here in par-
