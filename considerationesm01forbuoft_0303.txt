37ae Canon of tlae Scriffl'ures. 245

Greeks began to be troubled at it, the Pope said, that, “ where
he and the Emperor of the East, (without any notice taken
of the lVestern Emperor) with his Patriarch, were met toge-
ther, there needed no more to make a general council: for
all Christendom met in them; and no man believed other-
wise.'' But who can here believe the Pope P—specially, when
the council at Basilq condemned that at Florence for a schis-
matical synagogue, (as that at Florence did it,) and with
worse ternis than those. But, whatsoever either of these two
synods did, or whatever it was that Pope Eugenius decreed,
certain it is, that neither the Greek, nor the Latin Church,
(before the synod at Trent‚) ever observed any such decree,
or received all the books of Scripture that Caranza reciteth‚
as equally, strictly, and properly canonical. For the Latius
(those that were of the chiefest name among them both then
and after) made no more account of any such decree, (if any
such were,) than the Greeks did os the pretended union,
who‘, as soon as they were returned, and got home to Con-
stantffiople, would stand to nothing, that their own sudden
sear, and the Pope's persuasions, had for the time brought
them to in Italy.

CLXI. Among the Latius in this age, that, notwithstand-
ing this pretended papa] decree at the oouncil of Florence,
were of no such mind as they that follow the eouncil of
Trent are now, first of all, we have Antoninus, who knew,
far better than Caranza did, what was done at Florence‚
where he was presentt at divers of the disputations there,

held between the Greeks and the Latins 3 and, being after-

καζεν ἡμᾶς αὐτὸ τὸ πρᾶγμα ἐνεργεῖσθαι
