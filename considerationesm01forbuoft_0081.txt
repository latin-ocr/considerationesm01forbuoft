the Canon of the Scriptures. 23

Psalms :'—for these were ‘all the canonical Scriptures2' that
the old Church received upon divine authority.

XXXII. Nor did the ApostleS, after Christ, ever recommend
any other Scriptures of this nature to us, than what were
contained under those three heads: whereof they give us
these distinctive and proper characters by which we may
know them 3—that they “were written by Moses and the
Prophetsu 3²² that “by those prophets God spake of old time
to our fathers 3³² that “ all their prophecies were sure and
certain 3³³ that “not so much as one word or tittle of them
should ever fail 5¹³ that “all Scripture is of divine inspiration 3⁹²

XXXIII. Then, in all the New Testament, we find not
any one passage of the Apocryphal books to have been
alleged x, either by Christ or His Apostles, for the confirma-
tion of their doctrine, no examples produced from them, 110
advertisement given, no mention made of them (more than
of other foreign writings) at all. Which is an evident sign,
that, what account soever they had them in besides, yet
they never held them to be of the same eqnal and divine
authority with the prophetica] and canonica] Scriptures
themselves5 whereof (over and above the high and vene-
rable characters that they give of them in general) they
mention not much fewer than three hundred passages in
particular.
