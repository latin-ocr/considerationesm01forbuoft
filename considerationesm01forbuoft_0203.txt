the Canon of the Scriplures. 145

in a council kept there under the consulate of Honorius XII.
and Theodosius VIIL, which was in the year 419, three years
before Pope Boniface died. Yet in that African canon there
was not so much, nor so many books to be seen, as there is
in the Roman edition: for neither in the Greek codem, one
or other, nor in the collection of canons that Cresconius
made, (who was an African bishop himself‚) shall we find any
mention at all of the books of the MaccabeeS, or of the book
of Baruchn 3 towards the canonizing whereof this canon there-
fore will do no good. And, for the rest that be now contested,
if we admit them to be canoniea] upon S. Augustine's terms0,
(whom herein the council followed) it will do us no hurt.
For, in a large and common sense, as they be books appointed
to be read in the Church for the more ample (lirection and
instruction of the people in a pious and regular course of life,
(in which senseP that council took them‚) or as they are to
be preferred before all other ecclesiastica] books, (in which
sense S. Augustine took themQ) and as they are opposed to
supposititious, apocryphal, and rejected books, (in which sense
both S. Augustiner and this councilS, besides divers other of
