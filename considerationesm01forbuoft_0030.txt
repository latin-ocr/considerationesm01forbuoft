xxiv 'ro THE READER.

was not so much as a tradition received in their own Church
before, (as will appear by this present history‚) nevertheless
commanding it to be received as a necessary article of faith,
under pain of their unhallowed curse, and the peril of eternal
damnation,—this is so high and transcendent a presumption,
as that God Himself hath laid His curse upon it ; whereof it
concerns them to take heed, lest what they have vainly laid
upon others do not effectually reach to themselves, and fall
upon their own heads.

But after this manner they began to set up their first
doctrina] tradition, in their last Council, at Trent, which
they call an OEcumenical Council, as if all the Bishops in
Christendom had been there present, and voted in it ; when
it is well known, that at the same timea wherein this their
additional canon of Scripture was first made, (which was
then done chiefly by the procurement of Catharin, and his
faction there, whose credit had otherwise been quite lost,
having been much impaired already by his former and fierce
opposition herein against the writings of Cardinal Cajetan,
the far more learned and Catholic Doctor of the two,) it
consisted not of above fifty persons in all; among whom
some of them were only Prelates titular, and hired with
pensions to serve the present turn.

And the rest of their traditions that follow, (wherein now
consisteth the very life and being of their peculiar and proper
religion, that differeth from ours, and the true Catholic Re-
ligion of every Church, and every age before them,) having
been confirmed by Pope Pius his bullb, and made so many
new articles of their faith0, (as the former was,) are all alike.
