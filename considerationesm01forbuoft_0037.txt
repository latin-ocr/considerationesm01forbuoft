last Couneil of Trent, ought to be wholly, and inviolately‚

But all these new traditions, as they have no ground in
Scripture, so have they as little testimony of antiquity to be

estate and health of our souls, in a greater soundness and
purity of Religion, than indeed we were before, when they
had to do with it, and infected us :)—that these men, Ι say,
