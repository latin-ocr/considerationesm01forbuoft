class, and allowing no divine or canonical authority (in that
sense wherein divine and eanonical is strictly and properly
taken) but to those books only which were consigned to the
Chureh for absolute and infallible rules of all our religion by
the special appointment of God Himself. In a larger and
general sense (as divine is applied to holy and divine matters,
and canonieal to the rules of good life and mannerS, or to
the confirming of us in that Faith which is founded upon the
infallible Scriptures alone) we seruple not to call the debated
books holy and divine Scripturesz, no more than the Fathers
did 3 and, though we make them not of equal authority with
the eanonical books of Moses and the prophetS‚ yet this
honour we do them, that we bind them up with our Biblos,
for the good and religious use which may be made of them
by all men: otherwhiles we read many parts of them in our
churches 3 and we prefer them before any private writings
or books that are not canoniea] whatsoever.

LXXVIII. And here we conclude the first four eenturies:
in all which time the greatest searchers into ecclesiastieal an-
tiquities are not able to produce any Couneil, or so much
as the testimony of any one Father, who (purposely treating
and declaring the exact number of all the books that pro-
perly belonged to the Old Testament) did not either expressly
exclude, or at least omit, those which are now made equal to
the former by the new canon of the Roman Church. For it
is not enough to bring the sayings of any ecclesiastieal
writers, whieh will evinee nothing more than, whilst they
were diseoursing upon other matters, that they made an
honourable mention of some one or two of these books, and
cited a few sentences out of them, which, either in so many
words, or in the same sense, are to be found in the canonica]
books themselves. But the question is, whether ever any
Church or ancient author, during these first ages, ean be
shewed to have professedly made such a catalogue of the
true and authentic books of Scriptum, as the council of
'I'rent hath lately addresscd and obtruded upon tho world:
