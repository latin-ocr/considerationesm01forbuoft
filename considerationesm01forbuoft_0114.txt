56 A Sclzolastical History of

CHA P. one after another, in the same order that we do now; (as

v1. likewise he <ioth those of the New.) 'rhen he addeth, that
these books only be the fountains of salvation, from whence
all doctrine of piety and religion is preached, and where-
unto none ought to add, nor none to detract any thing
from them. And afterwards in the end, to distinguish these
canonical books the more exactly from them which were
termed only ecclesiastical, he held it necessary to tell themk,
that there were also some other books, not admitted into
the canon of the Bible, but registered and proposed by the
Fathers of the Church to be read by those that were new
beginners in religion, such as the Wisdom of Solomon¹‚ the
VVisdom of the son of Sirach, Esther, (to be. understood of
the Greek additions to Esther 3 for elsewhere he acknow-
ledgeth the history of Esther, which we have from the He-
brews, to be canonicaL) Juffith, Tobit, and a book called
The Apostles' Doctrine, besides the Pastor of Hermes. Of
the Maccabees and Susanna here is no mention, (peradven-
ture omitted in the transcript ς) but 116 will name them also,
and give them their own place, by and by. In the mean-
while, the distinction which he makes here between the
canonica] and the ecclesiastical books, severing all other
apocryphal writings from them both, (of which triple di-
vision we shall give a further account hereaften) is in this
place proposed by himm, as a matter constantly delivered in
the Church from the Apostles' days to his.
