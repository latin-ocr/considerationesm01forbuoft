(4.) Moreover, he admitteth a subdivision even of this latter
kind, whereof some might be received by the greater, and
some by the better sort of menh3 which notwithstanding, (be-

he thought to be of equal authority. (5.) And, lastly, he
premiseth this caution before the recita] of his general

neglected by him that readeth itk.

If the eouncil of Trent (whereby the Roman Church is
now governed) had set such a preface before their canon of
Scriptures, as this is that S. Augustine set before his, and
had added no more to the end of it than he did, they might
have had the fairer plea for themselves. But so far are
they from allowing their canon to be received with any such
qualifications and distinctions as these be, that, first, they
command all the books recited in it, (among which are those
that all Churches, at least, received not, and none at all in
their sense,) to be “equally accepted, and taken with the
sels-same venerationl,” as having all a like absolute and
divine authority annexed to them, without preferring one
before another, and then they damn all the Churches of
the world besidesm‚ that will not thus receive that canon
upon their own terms: which neither S. Augustine, nor any
other Father before or after him, ever did; who, when they
give us such a canon or catalogue of Holy Scripturcs as we
read here in his book of Christian Doctrine, give us a fair
latitude withal of taking the canon in a common and large
