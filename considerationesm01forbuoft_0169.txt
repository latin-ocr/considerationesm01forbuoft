to clear the other like exceptions that are made concerning
the books of WVisdom and Ecclesiasticus ¹¹3 but, when to this
purpose they produce his commentary upon the Psalmsx‚
they bring in a false witnessv‚ and confute S. Jerome by a
bold impost0r2. And thus have we made it to appear (other-
wise than Cardinal Du Perron pretended) that S. J erome was
always constant herein to himself. For in the year 392 he
avowed his translation of the Biblea 3 before which he placed
his Prologus Galeatusb‚ as a helmet of defence against the
introduction of any other books that should pretend to be
of equal authority with it. Not many years after, he wrote
his prefaces upon T obit and J udith, and therein he changed
not his mind. About the same time he wrote his commentary
upon the prophet Haggai, and his Epistle to Furia, wherein the
book of J udith remaineth uncanonized. In the year 396 116
wrote his Epistle to Laeta, and therein 116 is still constant to his
prologue. About the same year he wrote upon the prophet
Jonas, where the book of Tobit is kept out of the canon. In the
year 400 (or somewhat after) he wrote upon Daniel, and there
Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, have no authority of divine
Scripture. And at the same time he wrote his Apology
against Ruffin, where he referreth to his former prologueS,
