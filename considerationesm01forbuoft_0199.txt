tlte Canon of the Scriptures. 141

which made no such account of it, as they did of the Law,

the Prophets, and the Psalms: secondly, by the testimony —-

of Christs, which that book wanted, and the others had, as
His own proper witnesses ; and, thirdly, by the consent and
testimony of the Christian Chureht, which received it, not
unprofitably, if it were discreetly and soberly read, that is,
(as S. Augustine elsewhere expoundeth himself,) if those
things that we read there be conferred with the sacred and
canonical Scriptures, that whatsoever is thereunto agreeable
may be approved, and what is otherwise may be rejected.

To collect, therefore, (as the Cardinals and their followers
do,) out of these bare words—“ The books of the Macca-
bees are received in the Ch·urch‚’'—that they are not in the
J ews', but in the Christian canon of Scripture, and properly
so called, is altogether against common sense and reason:
for S. Augustine here intendeth to abate and weaken the
argument of the Circumcellions3 and this collection of the
Cardinals addeth moreu strength and force to it than it had
before 3 when from hence Gaudentius the Donatist might have
replied and said, that S. Augustine was so far from confuting
him, as that he had confirmed him in his former opinion, and
given him a fair advantage to insult over the orthodox Chris-
tians‚ who allowed him a testimony taken out of a book that
belonged to their own canon, and not to any canon or Scrip-
ture of the Jews. For this had been enough to have yielded
him the victory 3 which was none of S. Augustine's meaning:
who, by his limitations and restrictions here mentionedx,
makes it evident that the Law and the Prophets were another
