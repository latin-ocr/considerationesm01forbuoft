their time) held an heresy to reject it. For though some
few men in the Greek Church were not always so well satis-
fied concerning the author of this book, but doubtedy whe-
ther it was S. John the Evangelist, or some other apostoli-
cal writer of that name,-—yet, as the reasons which they
brought for themselves were of little weight, so they were
at all times opposed and answered by the greater part and
the most considerable persons of the Church 3 whereof there
cannot one be named, that ever suffered the authority of the
book to be either rejected or doubted of, whether it were a
canonica] part of the New Testament or no, without cen-
suring and condemning them that did so. 4. Lastly, then,
the omission of this book in the canon of Laodicea, (if yet
the omission be not rather in the copies that we have of it,
than in the canon itself3 for in some copiesZ the Epistle to
Philemon is left out, as well as the Apocalypse,) can be no
just plea for the authority of those books which the council
of Trent hath lately annexed to the canon of the Old Testa-
ment ; for though neither of them be here named, yet it is
one thing not to be named in the canon of Laodicea, and
another thing to be excluded out of the canon of the Bible‚
which maketh the great difference between them, for cer-
tain it is, that by the common consent of the Fathers and
Churches abroad, (which are the best interpreters of what
they decreed, rejected, or acknowledged, in this synod of
the Asian provinces,) the Apocalypse, if it were not usually
read to the people, yet was publicly received as a canonical
