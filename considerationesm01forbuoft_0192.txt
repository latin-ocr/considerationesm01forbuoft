VH' speak after an exact and distinct manner, they do them-
selves) to that strict and univocal acception‚ which makes it
only to be of pure and sovereign authority: for this is the
distinction that preserves the difference between that canon
of books which is absolute and Divine‚ and that which is not

simply so, but mixed and Ecclesiastical.

Nor can S. Augustine here be taken in any other sense.
For, of the canonical books strictly so called, none can be
preferred before another 3 (because in respect of their autho-
rity, infallibility, and certainty, there is no difference be-
tween them ,·) nor is it in the choice of any Churches, whe-
ther they will receive them or no 3 as it is not in the election
of any person, whether he will follow any Church that should

vide num. not receive them, (whereof there is no example or instance to

ix. be given.) But, of the canonical and Scripture books (largely
and mixedly taken) there is no better advice than S. Augus-
tine here gives,—to prefer those that all Churches receive,
(and such are the twenty-two books of the Old Testament,)
before those other that but a few receive, (and such are the
six books contested.)

To this advice we will add another, which is, to the same
purpose, given every man that reads this and other places
of S. Augustine, by one of the most learned cardinals¹¹ (but
lie lived not to see the new canons made at the synod of
Trent) that ever the Cliurch of Rome had: who (acknow-
ledging no more books of the Old Testament to be properly
canonical, than we and all the Churches that consent with
antiquity do) counselleth his reader⁰ not to be troubled at
