CHAP. truly, for as much as pertaineth to them in the Old Testa-

XVIII. ment, (for we acknowledge no such distribution in the NeW‚)
there may be a good use made of this distinction, whereby to
reconcile the Epistle of Pope Innocent, (if ever there was
any such,) and the catalogue that S. Augustino and the
council of Carthage made, to the universal consent of the
Church‚ before and after their times. For the second canon
was never made equal to the first, nor did they intend to
attribute the like authority in all things to all the books of
either sort together. But, in the mean while, there will be
no such use of this distinction had, to reconcile the decree of
the council at Trent, either to S. Augustine, or to S.
Augustine’s ancestors, or to any other ecclesiastical writer
that followed him. For our new masters will by no means
grant, that the books of the second order are to be dis-
tinguished from the first, as any way second or inferior to
them in dignity,—but contend and believe, that they have
both alike as much truth, and equally as much authority,
the one as the other 3 admitting no other difference between
them, than a difference of time only, wherein they were
written and made known to the world 3 and hereupon com- 1
manding all the world, upon pain and peril of their eternal
perdition, to believe as they do, (or, at least, say they do, if a
man might believe and trust them,) that it is no less a neces-
sary article of the Christian Faith, to believe the books, which
we call apocryphal, to be as canonical as the other are, and
both to be penned by the Holy Ghost, than to believe that
God is the Creator of heaven and earth, or that Christ was
born of the blessed Virgin: for they have put both thesed,
