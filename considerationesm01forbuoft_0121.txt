the Canon of the Scriptures. 63

France then received no other :—“ the first five of Moses 3
the sixth of Joshua, the seventh of Judges and Ruth3 the
eighth of the first and second of Kings, the ninth of the
third and fourth of Kings 3 the tenth of the two books called
the Chronicles 3 the eleventh of Ezra, (wherein Nehemiah
was comprehendes] ι) the book of Psalms made the twelfth5
the Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of SongS,
made the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth ς the twelve
Prophets made the sixteenth : then Isaiah, and Jeremy,
together with his Lamentations, and his Epistle, (now the
twenty-ninth chapter of his prophecy,) Daniel, and Ezekiel,
and Job, and Esther, made up the full number of twenty-two
books.'' Unto all which enumeration he setteth likewne his
Preface, (which is specially to be noted,) that in this sort the
ancient Fathers had delivered over these books to posterityS.
And this testimony is so clear, that Cardinal Bellarmine hath
nothing to say against it, but rangeth S. Hilaryt among those
ancients who herein evidently followed the Hebrew canon of
the old Bible, and are therefore, by his own confession, so to
be understood, that they acknowledged not any of the con-
troverted books to belong thereuntou. Some indeed there
were in S. Hilary's timex, who of their own heads augmented
the number of twenty-two, by adding the books of Tobit and
Judith; but he approves them not. And though otherwhilcs
he quoteth the books of Wisdom y, Ecclesiasticus ², Tobita, and
