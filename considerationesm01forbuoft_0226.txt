wrote a book in the time of Ptolemyd king of Egypt3 for
he attributeth five books to Solomone, whereof Ecclesias-
ticus must be one, that was written by Sirachf seven hun-

in our case is concerning a matter of fact, in a time long
since past, which no power is able to change into any other
thing than at that time it was, and make it what it was not.
The demand then being, What are the canonical books of
the Old Testament, (which was now past and gone four whole
ages before the time of Pope Innocent,) recourse is to be had
unto the time of the Old Testament itself, that herein must
only give us our sure and certain resolution. For, if the pope
had an omnipotent faculty, yet that faculty could not revoke
a time, nor make things then to be, that then had no being;
as it is both confessed here by the J esuit, and was made clear
before, that his new canonical books had then no such being
at all. Besides, Pope Innocent’s answer was not given to
Exuperius in such high terms of authority (whereby to regu-

here would have it 3 for he answereth only as far as his
understanding gave him leaveg, and according as his reason
persuaded him, having first consulted the books, and the
order of times wherein they were written. But, if he had
made the ecclesiastical books of equal authority with the
canonical, or determined those writings to be parts of the
Old Testament, which never were acknowledged by them
that lived under it properly to belong thereunto, his answer
had been clear otherwise than what his understanding led
