CHAPTER ΙΙΙ.

THE TESTIMONY OF THE FIRST CHRISTIAN AND APOSTOLICAL CHURCH.

XXX. IN the writings of the New Testament, though we
have no particular catalogue given us of all the several
books which belonged to the Old, yet by the special notes
and characters, that are there both by Christ and His Apo-
stles set upon them, we may evidently distinguish them from

all other books whatsoever.

XXXI. And first the ‘Scriptures,' that Christ recom-
mended to His disciples, related to the former partition that
had been made of them by the Jews, and were no other than
what were then found ‘written in the Law of Moses, in the
Prophets, and in the Psalms 3’ (where the Psalms compre-
aMoyse,—-hended all the Hagiographa, and, being the first and most
eminent book among them, gave the denomination to the
rest :) so that all those Scriptures which are not contained
within this division, and cannot be referred to one of these
three classes, (as none of the controverted Scriptures can
be,) are by Christ Himself excluded out of the canon of the

Old Testament.

For to those three He reduced all the

Scriptures that were then extant¹', or acknowledged by Him.
Which is likewise S. Augustine's own confession, and the
true sense that he gives to this place in S. Luke, when for

division, because ‘they had not the testimony of Christ to
be His witnesses⁵,' and were ‘neither comprehended in the
books of the Law of Moses, nor in the Prophets, nor in the
