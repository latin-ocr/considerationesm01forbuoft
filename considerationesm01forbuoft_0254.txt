THE TES'I'IMONIES OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL WRITERS IN THE
NINTH CENTURY.

CVIII. At the beginning of this age our countryman
Alcuin lived, in great honour ancl estimation of the world3
who, being brought up under Venerable Bede in the Church
of England, was afterwards invited by Charles the Great into
France, and there employed as his chief tutor in all learning
both secular and sacred. Among other of his works, there is
one that he wrote against Elipantus the bishop of Toledo 111
Spain, who h, to maintain his error touching the adoption of
Christ, had produced for his proof a saying out of Ecclesias-
ticusi, having no other Scripture, or proof, out of all the ca-
nonical Prophets to allege for himself. The answer, that Al-
cuin returneth to this proof, makes it clear that Ecclesiasti-
cus was none of the canonica] books in his Bible. For, first,
116 tells Elipantusk, “That the prophets of God failed him,
whereof he had never a one to bring for the defence of his
error 3 and then, that the book of the Son of Sirachl, which
he had produced, was, both by S. J erome's and Isidore's
undoubted testimonies, reputed but an apocryphal, and a
dubious scripture, having not been written in the time of
the ProphetS, but in the time of the Priests only, under
Simon and Ptolemy.'’ By which words it is manifest, that
neither Alcuin, nor the Church of England where he had

ut supr.]-Dum tuae perversitati defe-
cerunt in Prophetis Dei testimonia,
errori tuo convenientia, finxisti tibi
novum quendam prophetam dixisse,
‘Miserere Domine‚' &c.; . . . [Addi-

ista non est in Divinitate, sed in sola
humanitate, et 111 carne adoptiva quam

in interpretatione sententiae! Et non
frustra oportebat novum doctorem
novum sibi invenire Prophetam.

haec praefata sententia legitur; quem
librum B. Hieronymus atque Isidorus
inter Apocryphas, id est, dubias Scrip-
turas deputatum esse absque dubita-
tione testantur. Qui etiam liber non
tempore prophetarum, sed sacerdotum
sub Simone pontifice magno, regnante
Ptolomaeo Euergete, conscriptus est.
