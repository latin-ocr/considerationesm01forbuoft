C H AR forbiddeth the reading of any apocryphal book, we are not
VI to understand him so, as if he meant hereby the books of
Tobit and J udith, and the rest of that class which we now
call apocryphal, (though we might more aptly call them
ecelesz'astz‘cal ;) for he read them, and quoted some of them
himself ¹³, being such books that had been of ancient time
received in the Churchl, to be read unto the people at
their first entrance and introduction to a Christian life. By
S. Cyril⁷s apocrypha] booksm, therefore, we are to under-
stand some other disapproved and obscure writings, that
(over and besides both the canonica] and ecclesiastical books)
certain private persons then went about to bring in, and re-
commend to the Church at Jerusalem, as they had likewise
endeavoured to do in the Church at Alexandria, and other
places abroad. And, whereas he specially exhorteth them
here “to read the twenty-two books of the Old Testament
which the Septuagint translated ¹1,'' we are further from
hence to observe, that, although both he at Jerusalem, and
S. Athanasius at Alexandria, together with other Churches,
had not the use of the Hebrew Bible among them, but
kept themselves only to the Greek Translation of the LXX,
(whereunto were afterwards commonly added those eccle-
siastical booksO, which the Hellenist Jews first introduced
and received into their Churches, that so all the most emi-
nent books of religion written in the Greek tongue before
Christ's time might be put together and contained in one
