Wisd.4.11.

Solomon: and hereby (if Cardinal Bellarmine's collection
from hence might stand and hold firm) he maketh the whole
book of Wisdom to become canonical, no less than the books
of the Law and the holy Prophets are.

But, that S. Augustine was of another mind, we have
divers clear arguments to evince it. For, first, when he had
produced this testimony out of Wisdom, (that the righteous
man is speedily taken away, lest wickedness should alter his
understanding,) and some exceptions had been taken against
him by the divines of Marseilles, for citing a book which was
not canoniealr, (as in those days they had no such canonical
book in the Church of France,) he doth not answer and reply
that they said not true, or that the book was of equal autho-
rity with any other of the Bible, (and yet this he would have
said, if it had been equally canonical,) but he pleads only that
it ought not to be rejectedS, for the great veneration that it
had in the Church‘: where, secondly, notwithstanding that ve-
neration, it had certain marks of difference set upon it, (and
here noted by S.Augustine himselfi) to distinguish it from
being as divine and canonical as the Law and the Prophets
be3 of which marks this was one, that the book of Wisdom
and the rest of that class were given to the lectors, or the in-
ferior Officers of the Churchu, to be read there by them in a
lower place than those of the higher class were, which the
priests and bishops read themselves in a more eminent and
conspicuous mannerX 3 and this was another, that such au-
thors, as he that wrote the book of Wisdom, had only the
honour to be set firsty, and preferred before all other tracta-
