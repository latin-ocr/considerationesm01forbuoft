CVH A P. most unjustly‚ to be judge there in his own causes—knowing
XVIII. well what accusations were laid against him, both for arro-
gating to himself an absolute and universal monarchy over
all the Churches of the world, (falsely pretended to be given

and for many other enormous abuses in religion, which by
