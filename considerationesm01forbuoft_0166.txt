same mind which he had professed before in his prologues,
as well touching this particular book, as others of the like

that can be seen there, he revoketh nothing3 and, though
the request of his friendsb was so pressing and urgent upon

cause there were good examples of piety, chastity, and mag-
nanimity in itc, and because the fame went that the 001111011
of Nice had numbered it among other holy writingsd,—yet
all this makes it not canonica] Scripture, nor did he ever ac-
knowledge it so to be. For there may be many excellent
rules and examples of virtuous actions in sundry holy books,

Bible 3 and the council of Nice, or some particular person in
that council, might not only cite such a book, but reckon it
likewise among the sacred Scripturese, (as we in the Church
of England and other reformed Churches do at this day,)

Scriptures themselves have, which we 0111577 acknowledge to
have been written by the Prophets and Apostles, as they
were infallibly directed by the Holy Ghost. For this honour
