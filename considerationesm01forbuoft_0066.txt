herein the canon of the council of Trent hath made the
Roman Church to differ both from itself, (considered as it
was in former ages,) and from all other Churches besides,
by adding to the old canon (strictly and properly so taken)
six entire books which were never in it before, that is to

this new council, (where the pope and his partizans, both
in this and in many other divine matters besides, took a
most enormous liberty to define what they pleased,) were

canonical Scriptures: to the body whereof they have now
not only annexed them, and made the one to be of ‘equal
authorityh’ with the other, but they have likewise added this
