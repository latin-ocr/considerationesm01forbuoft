the Canon of tlte Serapam-es. 257

Erasmus his time, who had so many corrivals, both envious Tasr.
of his glory, and desirous of his ruin, yet there was not one caum-*xva
among them all, (not Sutor, and Bedda, not any (1001018 of

Spain or Italy, not the Sorbonists themselves, who censured

divers other of his writings,) that found any fault with him

for all these, which he had published concerning the differ-

ence betwixt the canonical and apocryphal or ecclesiastica]

CLXXIII. Cardinal Cajetan was at this time the common AD.
oracleh, to whom most of the divines in the Church of Rome 1534&
had recourse, for their better resolution· in any difficult 01
doubtful question, that occurred about the Scriptures, and.
the public doctrine of the schools: so that his testimony will
involve many more, and be of as good authority, as if we
should now produce a great numberi of witnesses for us
together. And in this particular question he declareth him-
self (oftener than once) to be formally for us. Somewhat he
had said to that purpose in his Commentaries upon Thomas
Aquinask3 but afterwards, in his Commentaries upon the
Bible, (which he wrote at Rome,) he spake more clearly.
