which is now extant under his name, and was first written
only in the Greek tongue :—a book so different in the present

LXII. Then, as to the leaving out of the Apocalypse,
(which is a second exception against this canon of Laodicea‚)
though the question between the followers of the Trent
canon and ours be not concerning any books of the New

to say for the council: 1. That the preface which they make
to their canon sheweth their intention only (or at least
chiefly) to have been thereby to declarep what canonica]
books were publicly to be read among them in the church3
where, because their custom was not usually to read the
Apocalypse‚ therefore they forbare to name it. 2. That this
custom was not grounded upon any opinion they had, as if
that book were no part of the New Testament, but because
it was so replenished with abstruse and hidden mysteries q, as
that (few or none being fit and able persons to explain it)
the people would receive the less instruction and edifying by
it3 which is the reason that, in our public Calendarr for read-
ing the books of the New Testament in the ordinary course
of the year, our own Church hath likewise omitted it3 and
yet we hold it to be canonical, (as they of the Greek ChurchS
