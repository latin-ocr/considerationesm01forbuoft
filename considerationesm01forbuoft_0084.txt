C HAP- found in Ezek. i. 28f3 Esay ix, 63 lx. 1 3 Psal. ii. 73 cxxxvi.
111. 53 2 Sam. vii. 145 Jer. li. 155 x. 12 3--to some of which
places the Apostle himself refers in this place to the He-

verse 5. brews. Thirdly, that which is said of Enoch (Heb. xi. 5.)
iirss'difljg] needs not the book of Wisdom to confirm it3 for the story
Gen-„g- 24. is clear in Genesis 3 and in the translation of the Septuagint,
{¹335 ἒκεν which S. Paul followed, the words are alike. Fourthly, that
ἓῑξέῑῃὲῗρ“ “the powers which be are ordained of God,'' was said by the

Rom. 13}- wisdom of God itself in Solomon. And, ‚fifthly, that “ God
{³30st 8‘1⁰'is no accepter of persons,” is taken out of the words of
{Off-2261] Moses in Deuteronomy. And yet there are that refer both
Εὲὴ. θ’. 9’; these maxims to the book of Wisdom, as if S. Paul had found

{225¹ 25. them no where else.

193 17. XXXVII. Next, for the authorizing of the book of Eccle-

w1sd.6.3‚7. siasticus, they produce S. Peter and the Epistle of S. J ames,

both of them citing this sentence out of the Old Testament:

1Pet.1.24. “All fiesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower

Jamess‘m' of grass: the grass withereth, and the flower thereos falleth

away 3 but the word of the Lord endureth for ever :²³ which

Esa.40.6,7. though it be word for word taken out of the Prophet Esay,

yet Sixtus of Sienna, Coccius, and P. Cotton, will needs have

Ecclus. 14. it fetched out of the fourteenth of Ecclesiasticus, wherewith

17. the words of the Apostles have no better agreement than the
grass of the field with the wearing of a garment.

XXXVIII. Thirdly, in favour of the book of J udith they

bring two citationsg, one made by S. Paul, when he said,

1Cor. 10. “They were destroyed by the destroyer,” and another by

ΞΟ· 223 S. JameS, who said: “The Scripture was fulfilled,.. . and

ames ’ ’ (Abraham) was called the friend of God :’'—both which pas-

sages (if there were any credit to be given to Serarius) are
