no man can 13011.υ Thirdly, we are there informed, “that the
Church permitteth the reading of the apocrypha] booksh‚
only for devotion and instruction of manners, but not for
any authority that they have to conclude controversies in
matters of Faith.’' Fourthly, that there be “ but twenty-two
canonical books of the Old Testament13 and, what books
soever there be besides, that they ought to be put among the
Apocrypha.'' This was the judgment of all learned men, and
the common belief of the Church, in those days3 wherein, if
any particular or private persons were of another mind, they

are here condemned of ignorance, and want of knowledge in
the Scriptures.

CXXXVI. Which judgment is not only here declared, and
proposed, by the authors of this Ordinary Gloss themselves,
but confirmed likewise by the testimonies of the ancient
Fathers 3 among whom, though the chiefest attestations
which they bring are out of Origen, S. J erome, and Ruffin,
yet they take notice of S. Augustine also, and of his dis-
tinction between those apocryphal, or ecclesiastical books,
that are of greater authority, (which therefore he putteth
into his larger catalogue,) and those that are of a lesser
account, (which therefore he leaveth out.) But, whatsoever
S. Augustine had said, the common consent of the Church
now was, to acknowledge no more books for canonica] Scrip-
ture, than those that Ruffin and S. J erome had received from
their ancestors, and recorded to posterity. In which regard,
when they come to the several books of Tobit, J udith, Wis-
dom, Ecclesiasticus, and the Maccabees, they prefix this title
to them allk z ‘¹ Here beginneth the book of Tobit, which is
