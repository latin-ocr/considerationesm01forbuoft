CL. Thomas sui-named Anglicus, CLI. and Thomas of VValden, both
Englislnnen, follow S. Jerome's account. CLII. Paulus, the Bishop of
Burgos in Spain, in his notes printed with the Gloss upon the Bible, con-
tinueth the same distinction between the canonica] and apocryphal books.
CLIII. The Council of Florenee urged against it. Becanus the Jesuit's
extravagancy. CLIV. A brief history of that 001111011 at Florence. Schism
among divers Popes. Decrees of the Council of Constance, wherein three
Popes were deposed. A Council began at Pavia, and ended at Sienne,
whereof no Acts are extant, but that the Clergy was deluded in it, and
another Council appointed at Basi13 which, as soon as they began there
to speak of Reform-atior), proved formidable to the Pope Eugenius the
Fourth. His bull sent forth to dissolve them: which they resisted, depos-

the Empire and Church in the East. The Turks invade them. Seeking

Legates from the Patriarch of Armenia. The ending of the CounciI, and
the departure of the Greeks. The Instruction said to be there given by
the Pope to the Armenians, concerning the seven pretended sacraments
and other rites of the Romish Chul-eh, an improbable tale. All this while
not a word spoken there of the Scripture canon. CLIX. Only Caranza,
(a Spaniard, and Consessor to Queen Mary of England,) in his Epitome
of the Councils hath substituted a decree 10 that purpose, which in the
Council itself was never made. CLX. And this (forsooth) is 1110 canon
of the pretended General Council at Florence, that is urged by Becanus
and other Rolnanists against us. Florenee 110 OEcumenical Council: 0011-
