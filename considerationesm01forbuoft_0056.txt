CLXXIX. Against all these, a few men at Trent made a (160166, to
control the whole Christian world3 and the Pope, when he confirmed this
decree‚ commanded it to be held as a necessary article of Faith‚ without
which no man might be saved. CLXXX. IVhereby they have miserably
rent the Church in pieces. CLXXXI. A brief history of the calling,
assembling, and proceedings in the Council of Trent. The reformation
of abuses begun 111 Luther’s time. Pope Leo the Tenth sendeth out his
111111, and commandeth that both Luther and all his adherents, (among
whom where the Duke of Saxony, and divers Princes of the Empire‚)
should be driven out of their countries. The Princes‚ for the preventing
os further trouble and schism, desire a free and General Council in some
convenient place of Germany. But Pope Leo, (to whom it was dreadful
to hear of such a Council‚) declined it, and presently died. CLXXXII.
Adrian the Sixth, his successor, promiseth reformati0n‚ 11111 lived not to
do any thing 111 11. CLXXXIII. Clement the Seventh, likewise, that fol-
lowed him, studiously avoided the calling of 3 Council‚ and died not long
after. CLXXXIV. But the next Pope, (Paul the Third‚) upon certain con-
ditions made with the Emperor, condescended to have it called at Mantua
in Italy: which came to nothing3 as did also a second summonS, that he
made ofit, to Vicenza: and, at last, he sent forth his bull ofIndiction to have
it held at Trent, by all Bishops and Abbots that were Sworn to his obedi-
ence. CLXXXV. Publio protestations set forth against it. CLXXXVI.
The Council deferred. CLXXXVII. The league between the Emperor
and the King of England3 at which the Pope stormeth. CLXXXVIII.
The Emperor and the French King agree to reform the Court of Rome,
and to restore the Church to her ancient purity: which made the Pope to
begin and order the Council 10 1115 own best advantage. CLXXXIX. His
instructions to his Legates. CXC. His OEcumenical Council‚ made up first
with twenty, and after with forty-three Prelates. Titular Bishops and
pensioners 10 the Pope, sent to increase the number. CXCI. The first
four sessione. Their Anathema added to their decree for their new canon
of Scripture. CXCII. Against which many learned mon pleaded there3
11111 1116 voices of Catharin’s faction prevailed sor it. CXCIII. The words
of the decree itself‘. CXCIV. For Which they had no Catholic Tradition,
Council‚ Father, Schoohnan, or other Ecclesiastical writer in former ages.
The small and inconsiderable number of men, thatnow gave their voices to
it. CXCV. The vanity of their pretended tradition for it. CXCVI. The
difference between them, and S. Augustin. The Council of Carthage,
Pope Innocent, Gelzmius, and EugeniuS. The novelty of their ac·
cui-sed Anathema. CXCVII. For which they have nothing to plead.
