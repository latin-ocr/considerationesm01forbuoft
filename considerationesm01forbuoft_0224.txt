nothing that makes to the Jesuit's purpose,——-which is, to
set all the apocryphal or ecclesiastical books of the Bible in
equal rank and authority with the canonical. But between
Eugenius and Gelasius there will come in so many to the
contrary, that Becanus will never be able either to maintain
his continual tradition against them, or to fetch his leap
over all their heads. That Gelasius received his catalogue
from S. Augustino, or S. Augustine from the council of Car-
thage, and the Council from Pope Innocent, is no way pro-
bablc. For, first, Gelasius received his decretal epistles, (all
but one,) and his synodica] declaration of the Scripture-
books, from Isidore Mercator, and Isidore Mercator (for
ought that any body knows) only from himself. Next, the
council of Carthage and Pope Innocent rather received their
catalogue from S. Augustine, than S. Augustine from them 3
for he wrote his books of Christian Doctrine before he was
made a bishop, to which office he was ordained seven yearsu
before Pope Innocent came to that dignityX‚ and ten years
before the epistle to Exuperius is said to be writtenv,--an
epistle that S. Augustine perhaps never saw, (at least he
makes no mention of it,) and which the council of Carthage
never heard of 23 who, following the enumeration of Scrip-
tures that S. Augustine had (with his restrictions and limita-
tions) set down before, sent it to Boniface and other bishops
of Italy, to see if they would approve it: which they would
never have done, if they had known of any former declara-
tion that Innocent had there made about it. Lastly, if Eu«
genius had it from [the pretended] Gelasius, and he from
S. Augustine, and S. Augustine from the Council, and they
from Pope Innocent,—-from whom did this pope receive it?

time to begin the primitive Church withan, as Becanus here
