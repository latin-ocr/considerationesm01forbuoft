with the Lamentatiorzs, and with his Ερωίίε, made but one
book 3 (that Epistle‚ therefore, must be contained and written
in that book, as it is in the twenty-ninth chapter of his Pro-
phecy ς) whereunto S. Athanasiusl and S. Cyril have added
Baruch, (like as the council of Laodicea did here,) and made
but one and the same book of them all. For Baruch's name

Jer. 36- 4. is famous in Jeremy3 whose disciple and scribe he was,
Jer. Α13.6,7. suffering the same persecution and banishment that J eremy
Jer.36.8, did, and publishing the same words and prophecies that

J eremy had required him to write 3 so that, in several rela-
tions, a great part of the book may be attributed to them
both. And very probable it is, that for this reason the
Fathers that followed Origen did not only (after his example)
join the Lamentations and the Epistle to Jeremy, but the
name of Baruch besidesm3 whereby they intended nothing
else (as, by keeping themselves precisely to the number of
twenty-two books only, is clear) than what was inserted con-
cerning Baruch in the book of J eremy itself ; (for otherwise
they must have angmented their account, and added one
book more to their number, which they never do ε) nor could
Cardinal Bellarmine take these Fathers in any other sense,
when he confessed and said, (though afterwaid he agreeth
not with liis own 110105) that “neither any ancient council,
nor pope, nor father, in reciting the books of Holy Scripture,
had made any particular mention of this prophet Baruch by
himself ¹¹:⁷² which would be false, if either the council of
Laodicea, or S. Athanasius, or S. Cyril of Jerusalem, had not,
by the mention that they make of Baruch, understood those
passages of him which are compreliended in the book of
Jeremy written in Hebrew, but that other distinct book,
