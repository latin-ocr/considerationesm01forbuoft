the Canon of tlte Scriptures. 71

the bishop of Corinths, for reading the Epistle of Clemcnt τηςτ.
in other churches, when they met together publicly to QL¹L
celebrate the Lord’s day. And to the same purpose we
had the testimony of S. Athanasius g, in his Pascha] Epistle
mentioned before, for the reading of the “Doctrine of
the Apostles,'' (which peradventure was the book of canons
set forth under their name, few at first, but in process of
time much augmented,) and the book that was called “The
Pastor.” All which, being ecclesiastica] writings and useful
for the instruction of the people, were put into a division or
class by themselves, and clearly distinguished both from the
canonical and from apocryphal books properly so termedh.
5. But, when among this ecclesiastical class some other men
had in divers places brought in and mingled those books
that were merely apocryphal, reading thern also to the
people under the specious title of Holy and Divine Scrip-
tures,—from hence it was, that the Fathers in the council of
Laodicea took occasion to make their canon, and held it
necessary to declare the number of those anthentic books
that were publicly to be read unto thepeople in the
church.

LXI. Yet, against our producing of this canon it is alleged,
that Baruch is added in the Old Testament, and the Apocalypse
left out in the New. For answer whereunto we say, first, (as
we did before to the place in S. CyriL) that this is not the Num. lviii.
Book of Baruch, which standeth separato by itself in the rank
of those that be controverted, but an exegetica] or fuller ex-

pression only of what is contained in the book of Jeremyi.
