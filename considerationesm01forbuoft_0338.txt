or thinketh any man can be saved, that believeth otherwise
than he and the council of Trent doth. Which shutteth up
the doors against all moderatim, and Christian charity, from
ever coming in to abide in their dwellings, that are tied to
maintain their own error, (this, and many more,) with such
passionate severity.

CXCVI. Somewhat, they think, is said to defend this de-
cree of their council from novelty, when they produce Pope
Eugenius, (and the council of Florence,) delivering to them
the same canon of Scripture, which they have delivered to
others3 and which he received, (at near a thousand years
distance,) from Gelasius 3 Gelasius from S. Augustine3 S. Au-
gustino from the council of Carthage3 and the council of
Carthage from Pope Innocent z—For these be all the autho-
rities‚ whereunto they are able to pretend for fifteen hundred
years together, and upwards, since their new canonical Scrip-
tures were first written. But, besides that these authorities
are some of them uncertain, and some misconstrued, and that
none of them were ever taken, (during all the respective ages
before, neither by one writer, nor other,) in that sense, to
which the masters and the disciples of Trent have lately
stretched them,—we will be bold to say, that they shall
never be able to shew the curstness of their anathema out of
any, or all these authorities together. For, howsoever, after
S. Augustine's time, they may happen to find two or three
writers that sometimes numbered the books promiscuously,
as he and the council of Carthage did,—yet they can never
find, that any of those writers either made the ecclesiastical
books equal to the canonical in their proper nature and
authority, or that Gelasius, or Eugenius himself, (if the
wandering decrees that go under their names were worth
the while to be here mentioned,) set their anathema and
their curse upon any man, to exclude him from the com-
munion of God’s Church upon earth, and from all interest
in the kingdom of heaven, if he would not forsake the old
canon to follow the new, and make no difference at all be-
tween Moses and the Maccabees: for this is it, (making the
two canons equal, and pronouncing them accursed that were
otherwise minded,) which the council of Trent hath done,—

and done it the first of any other persons in the world.
