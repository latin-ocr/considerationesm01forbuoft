in his preface upon Joshuad, he reciteth the books of the
Old Testament, and divideth them into their three orders, as
S. Hierome and the Hebrews do,—without saying, or insi-

had any other canon which differed from the Hebrew. In
the first order be the five books of Mosese3 in the second,
the eight books of the Prophets 3 and in the third, the nine
books (that remain) of the Hagiographa. If Comestor had
known any more, that yet remained of the Old Testament,
he would never have been so perfidious to himself, and the
Christians, (for whose use and benefit alone he wrote this his
Scholastical History,) as not to name any one of thern. But
clear it is, that he affirmeth absolutely, as well in his own
sense as in the sense of the old Church,——-that‚ after the five
books of the Law, and eight of the ProphetS‚ there remain
but nine more for the first Testament3 among which the
six debated books can have no roem. Otherwhere‚ when
he cometh to speak in particular of the book of Tobit, lie
