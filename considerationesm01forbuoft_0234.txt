both of the Greek and Latin Church held and taught con-
cerning the proper and authentic canon of Scripture 3 wherein
S. Augustine, and they that followed him, or the council of
Carthage, in effect differed not from them. For those Fathers
that take the canon in the strictest sense, (allowing no books
to be received in the Christian Church, as canonical, but such
only which the ancient Church of the Jews had received from

by pious and religious men under the Old Testament, to be
publicly read and made known to faithful people. So much
