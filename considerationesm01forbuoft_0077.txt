make that to have been, which never was, nor any thing to
be a truth which men know to be false. The truth is, that
the J udaical Church never had more than twenty-two books
of Scriptum, strictly and properly so taken, as is clear by
the former testimonies 3 and therefore the Christian Church,
which was to follow, and own the same Scriptures which
they did, (as being left to their charge and custody by Moses
and the prophets,) neither might nor did receive any other
from them.

XXVII. The exception which Cardinal Perron here
taketh against us for producing the testimony of J osephusg,
wherein he says the ‘book of Job is oniitted¹¹‚' is a mere
divination and fancy of his own. For from what words, of
all the passage recited before out of Josephus, may any man
collect that he counted not the book of J ob to be canonieal‘?
or what other book would the Cardinal have had added, to
make up the number of two and twenty? To allege for his
proofsthat ‘ in all the writings of J osephus there is no men-
tion made of Job’s history³,' is nothing to the purpose:
for Josephus‚ proposing to himself to write only the ‘Anti-
quities of the Jews& and to defend the honour and laws
of his own nation against Api0n1, had no occasion to write
any thing concerning the history or the defence of Job at
all, who was of another country, and needed not any further 201ῃίῃέᾓᾶ S
mention here, than to be reckoned by his book among the Num. 19
