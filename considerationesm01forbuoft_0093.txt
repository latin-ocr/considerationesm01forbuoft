he cites a saying out of the book of Wisdom ¹¹¹, which he calls
an Introduction to the Divine Oracles3 but by the confession
of Aquinas, who wrote a Commentary upon him ¹¹, this makes

Epistles of Ignatius and some others there cited with it to

XLVII. Before S. John died (who died the last of all the
Apostles) the canon of the Scriptures was made perfect ⁰, and
delivered over to the Christian Church. Divers years before
his death he had made his chief abode about Ephesus, and
SardiS, and the other Churches in Asia ; to which he wrote, Apocalyp.
when he was banished into the isle of Patmos by the Em- chap. 2, δ’
peror Domitian. From this banishment he was released by
Nerva, in the year of our Lord 973 and about three years
after he quietly ended his days. It happened that, about
sixty years from the time of his decease, there was some
question made by certain men that came and lived in those
quarters, concerning the exact number of the canonical books
of Scripture. For resolution herein, Melito q, who was then A. D. 160.»
