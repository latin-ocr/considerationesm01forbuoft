VIII XCI. But we have, in this age, the testimonies of two

African bishops to explain their own canon: one of J unilius3
A.D. 543 ¹· who, notwithstanding the mixture that S. Augustiue and the
council of Carthage made of the ecclesiastical and canonical
books together, acknowledgcth a great imparity betwixt
themy, and parteth them again (them and others) into their
several classes. For, first, he declareth that the canonical
books only are of sovereign and perfect authority 3 then, that
there be some others of a lesser, and others of no authority
at all: which is answerable to the order of the Greek Church,
which divided the canonical books from those that were suf-
fered to be read in public assemblies, and these from the
apocryphal, that were utterly rejected, and forbidden to be
used among them. Secondly, he excludeth out of his canoni-
cal classZ the books of J udith, VVisdorn, and the Maccabees,
which he expressly nameth, and (by the reason that follow-
eth) the rest of that rank also, which he nameth not. For,
thirdly, the reason that he giveth of this his distinction is,
because the Hebrews³‚ and S. Hierome, and other doctors of
the Church, had so distinguished them before him: which is
a clear profession, that he received no more books into the
canon than they did 3 and a clear argument withal, that the
copy of his writing is corrupted, where some. of the canonical
books recited in it are set out of their own orderb.
