CHAPTER IX.

THE TESTIMONIES OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL WRITERS IN THE
SEVEN'I'H CENTL'RY.

XCVII. But to make it manifestly appear, that in the
ages following there was no obligation put upon any man,
to observe either the pretended decrees of Innocent and
Gelasius, or the canon of the African council, and the
catalogue of S. Augustine, (at least, not 111 that strict sense
and acception, wherein they are all now produced by
our opposites, and urged against us,) but that the Church
continued still to observe the ancient canon of Scripture,
which the Christians had received from the Jews, and which
both S. J erome and Ruffin, and the other old writers before
them, had accurately delineated,—-we shall {for this purpose
take a view of the subsequent times, and the testimonies of
those ecclesiastica] authors that lived in them, and left any
record of this matter behind them, every one in their order.

XCVIII. We have already seen, that four patriarchal
Churches have declared themselves for us. (1.) For the
Church of Jerusalem furnished us with S. Cyril 3 (2.) The
Church of Alexandria with S. Athanasius3 (3.) The Church of
Antioch with Anastasius 3 (4.) And the Church of Constan-
tinople with S. Gregory Nazianzen , besides many others that
dcpended upon those several sees. And, if any credit may
be given to the writings of Clemens, the Church of Rome
also hath furnished us with the first patriarch and bishop [One

suffrage for us.
