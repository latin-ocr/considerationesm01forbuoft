pleads our easefz—that, “if the Nicene eouncil held the

-book of J udith (and the other books of that rank) to be

eanonical, why did the council of Laodicea omit it‘? and why
did Nazianzen make no mention of it‘? S. Hierome seemeth
to me to speak as one that doubted of it3 unless a man might
think that this and many more decrees besides, which the
council of Nice made, were afterwards pared away from it
by fraudulent heretics: whereunto Ι cannot give my assent,
for the religious honour that I bear to the fathers of Lao-
dicea 3 who, in that age when bishops knew the canons of the
Church best, and when it was their great commendation to be
skilful in them, could not be so far negligent both of their
eredit and their duty, as neither to know them, if they were
extant, noi² to seek after them, if they were lost. Besides, if
that were true which S. Hierome saith was “read'' of the book
of J udith, that ‘the Nicene fathers took it into the canon, how
shall we construe that which he writes in his preface before
the books of Solomon, that ‘though the Church indeed leads
the History of J udlth and Tobit, &c.‚ yet it doth not receive
them into the number of canonieal Scriptures. ‘2’ But, that
the Nicene council determined nothing in this matter, I arn
the rather induced to believe, for that the sixth general
council at Constantinople approved the canon of Laodicea3
which it would never have done, if the Fathers that met
there had either rejected or mutilated the canon of Nice.'’
