*Ay—lg& longed the five books of Moses, J oshua, J udges, and the rest
that we number; concluding that the ancient Fathers ad-
mitted no more, of whose authority it was not lawful for any
man to doubt.” Of the other books that were afterwards
received into ecclesiastica] use, (naming all those that we
account to be apocryphal, as Ruffinus and the old writers
did,) he is “ uncertain what manner of authority they have 3³²
but addeth‚ that “the canonica] Scripturesd are so called,
which, without any controversy, all men acknowledge to
have been written by the inspiration of God.'’ And, in his
scholies upon S. Jerome's preface to the Prophet Daniele,
he maketh a wonder at it, that such stories, as Bel and the
Dragon is, should be publicly read in the Church, which he
would never have done, nor found any fault with it at all, if
that Scripture had in his time been believed to be canonical.
But, for the reception of these books to be read in the
Church, it is his admonition to all them that study the
Scripturesf, “to consider well how far, and into what de·-
gree of authority, the Chnrch had so received them: for
She intended not to give the same weight of authority
and honour to the books of Tobit, Judith, and VVisdorn,
which is given to the five books of Moses, or the four
Evangelists :''—but maketh a great difference between them,
though it hath pleased the late congregation at Trent to
make them all alike and equal, and to give no more autho-
rity and honour to the one, than they do to the other:
wherein they had neither Father, nor any other good writer,

to go before them. And it is remarkable here, that in
