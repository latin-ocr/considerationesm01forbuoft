there be also some other books which arc not received into τπετ.
1110 former canon, but reckonecl without, and read only to ῘῙῩΨᾈὟΞ
beginners for their better instruction in manners, that is to
say, the Wisdom of Solomon, and the rest before recited.
3. Thirdly, in the conclusion he mentioneth the books of
the MaccabeeSZ, and the story of Susannah, together with
the former ; but gives this note upon them all, that thcy arc
111 1110 number of those books which be contradicted. In
this enumeration we find the book of Esther named; but it
is that book of Esther which beginneth (as there he saith
himself a) with the dream of Mmflecai, and not that canonical
history of Esther, which in our Bibles standeth next in order
to Ezra and Nehemiah. For this he acknowledgeth to be
among those booksb that the Hebrews had in their canon of
the Bible3 and, though he makes no particular mention of
it, when he reciteth 1110 rest which belong properly to that
canon, yet he omitteth not 10 give us notice immediately
after, that ⁰, as Ruth was (sometimes) countcd one book
with the J uclges, so was this with another: (that other was
Ezra, who is most probably held to have been the author
of itd.) And this Ι take to be a far better reason why
S. Athanasius here did not specially name 11, than that
which Sixtus the Dominican gives 118 for it in 1118 Bibliothe-
quee, where he rejecteth the new additions made to this book
