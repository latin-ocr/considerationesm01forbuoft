were allowed to be read, nor at Laodicea, where, for the rea-
sons afore-mentioned, they thought meet at that time to
forbid them.

LXIII. Some other exceptions there are against this coun-
cil, which will give us no great trouble to answer 3—as first,
(1.) That it is not so certain, whether there be any such
canon or catalogue of Scripture-books in it or no. For in
the Latin translation, which Dionysius Exiguusa made of that
council, it is omitted 3 and in the Roman codeb there is no
particular recital of those books to be seen ; nor hath Gra-
tian entered it into his Decreec. But in these matters the
Greek copies are to be trusted before the Latin, and the Uni-
versal coded before the Roman. In all the several editions of
the Councssse, both Greek and Latin, set forth by Mercator,
Merlin, Crab, Surius, Tilius, Binius, and those that we find in
Balsamon and Zonaras, this canon is to be read at large 3 and,
should we rest ourselves either upon the Roman code, or the
code of Dionysius Exiguus, we shall be to seek for all the eight
canons of the council of Ephesus, the three last canons of the
first council at Constantinople, and the two last canons of the
council at Chalcedon 3 which are all cut off and left out in
both these codes, as well as this canon of Laodicea is: the
preface and title whereof they have suffered nevertheless
to stand stillf 3 and yet that preface and title refer to the

in Cod. Rom. [The Roman code (apud
Justell.) is deficient of the canons
named by Cosin, viz. the eight canons
of the council os Ephesus, the last
three canons of the first council of Con-
stantinople, and the last two canons of
the council of Chalcedon. In the Co-
dex Canonum Vetus Eccl. Romanae
(Lut. Par. 1609) the canons specified
are wanting, except that there are
tmoli-e canons purporting to be those
of Ephesus, but altogether different
from the corresponding canons apud
Justell. In the Cod. Can. Ecclesiasti-
corum Dionys. Exig. (Lut. Par. 1628)
all the canons specified are wanting]
