decline that envy, and to lay it upon Ruffin’s shouldersy.
Yet, whatever either Origen's or Ruffin's errors were, certain
we are that this distinction, and severing of the canonical
books of Scripture from the ecclesiastioal and apocrypha]
writings of other men, was none of them. For herein
S. J erome altogether accorded with him, and he with S. J e-
rome‚ as both the one and the other did with the Church of
God, that was in their days and in the old time before them.
4. Fourthly, that Ruffin was S. Jerome’s disciple is rashly
said: for they had both one master²3 and the time was when
S. J erome thought it no disparagement to learn of bima, and
to set Ruffin’s credit before his own. But that Ruffin after-
wards retracted any thing of his former opinion in this par-
ticular subject about the canonica] books, it is as untruly
said as that S. Jerome retracted any thing of that matter
himself. For the controversy between them concerning the
history of Susanna, and the Song of the Three Childrenb,
&c., was not whether they were canonical Scripture or no,
(being both agreed that they were never comprehended in
that class‚) but whether they were such fabulous and false
