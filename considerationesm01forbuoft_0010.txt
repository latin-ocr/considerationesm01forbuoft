iv PREFACE.

On the other hand, it is a matter of satisfaction, that
altogether, throughout this volume, the references will be
found to have been, at the least, sufficiently verified to esta-
blish the accuracy, no less than the extent, of the author's
reading: making it evident, that, in those few instances
where the attempt at collation has proved wholly unsuc-
cessful, this failure (if not the result of some false reference
or misprint) can be only attributable to the inability of
the present editor to do complete justice to a work of so
much learning, and of so deep research⁸ And here it may
not be out of place to record the editor's thanks to the li-
brarians of the Bodleian Library, and of Lincoln College,
and Queen's College, Oxford, to the late librarian at Lam-
beth, to the librarians of Sion College, and to several gentle-
men at the British Museum, as well as to some private
friends 3 from whose kindness he has received much aid 111 his
search after some of the rarer editions, or less know 11 works,

referred to here and there in this volume.

Little requires to be said further, but to inform the reader,
that, for the most part, throughout the notes, Bishop Cosin’s
own words are distinguished from his quotations by the
former being included within parentheses (); whilst the
additions made by the editor have, in every instance, been
enclosed within brackets [ ].

Those editions of the authors referred to have been chiefly
employed, in the course of editing, which Bishop Cosin
himself appears to have used, where such could be ascer-
tained. Otherwise the Benedictine, or the best accessible
editions, have been usually resorted to. As, however, re-
course has been had not unfrequently to several editions of
the same work, it has been found desirable to prepare the fol-
lowing list, wherein, 111 each case, the edition commonly
used, (i. e. wherever, in the reference, 110 other is specified,)
may be readily distinguished by its priority of place.
