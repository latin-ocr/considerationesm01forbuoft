that advice, which should most tend to the honour of God,
and the advancement of His true religion.'' And, though the
legate was not so well pleased with these conditions which
they annexed to their demand of a council, yet they stood
strictly upon them, and thought them both necessary and
modest enough, and that the Pope could not be justly
offended with them. But, as soon as this answer was carried
back to Rome, the Pope had no leisure either to begin his
intended reformation, or to determine any thing about the
desire that was made of a council. For presently after he
also died, and Clement the Seventh was put into his place.

CLXXXIII, But this man, during· all the time of his
papacy, studiously declined the necessity of a councilp, and
would by no means hear of it, especially with condition to
have it celebrated in Germany: whereunto, notwithstanding,
he was often pressed by the Emperor himself, who one while
was minded, in case the Pope would not assent unto it, to
call it by his own authority, and otherwhiles solicited the
college of Cardinals to do it. But, the Pope and Cardinals
both fearing it was impossible to make the Germans accept
of such a council as might be most serviceable to the court
of Rome, and being resolute to have no other, they sent a
Nuncioq to propose those conditions about it, which they
knew would never be taken. And thus the time passed
away, till this Pope likewise fell into a sharp infirmity, which
made an end of his life.
